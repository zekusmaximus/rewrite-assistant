Chapter 1

Alice stepped into the study and closed the door behind her. She paused, listening to the quiet ticking of the brass clock. Morning light spilled across the desk where letters were stacked—one sealed in red wax.

She broke the seal and read the first line aloud. "To the heir who finds this—" The words made her throat tighten.

She found Bob in the hall and waved him over before saying anything else. Together they entered the study. The next morning, they would have to meet the solicitor, but for now they cataloged the letters and tried to make sense of the dates.

"This one mentions a locked trunk," Bob said. "It might be in the attic."

They climbed the narrow stairs. It was colder here; the windows were dusty and the floorboards creaked. Alice ran a finger along the railing and frowned at the gray line it left.

At the far end of the hall, a small door stuck fast. After a tug, it opened on a cramped space with a single trunk. It was heavier than it looked.

Back in the study, Alice set the trunk down. They searched for a key they hadn’t yet seen—perhaps it was hidden in plain sight. The afternoon wore on; the house grew quieter.

When she finally tried the tiny brass key from her grandmother’s brooch, the lock clicked. Inside were letters, a photograph of two sisters, and a folded map smeared with ink.

That evening, as rain began, Alice and Bob spread the map on the desk. Those lines—those notes in the margin—pointed to the old orchard beyond the wall.

"It’s not just an inheritance," Alice said. "It’s instructions." And though the next day would be harder, she felt steadier now, as if the house itself had decided to help.
