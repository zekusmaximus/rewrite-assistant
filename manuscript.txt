=== CHAPTER 01 ===

[SCENE: CH01_S01 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

The woman who would destroy civilization as we knew it sat cross-legged in a basement meditation cell, tears streaming down her face beneath a sleek black virtual reality headset.

The hum of the device resonated through Sherry’s temples, sending waves of warmth throughout her body. Patterns of light bloomed behind her closed eyes, emerging not as mere visuals but as if they were born from deep within her. Bright flares pulsed, commanding her attention, while softer, more fleeting shapes lingered at the edges, like whispers caught on a breeze. Each light, each pulse, resonated with a strange familiarity, weaving through her mind like a forgotten song.

Her breathing slowed, syncing with the pulse that throbbed at the base of her skull. Memories floated past her awareness like leaves on a still stream: the crisp scent of winter mornings, her father’s aftershave, the comforting weight of her camera in Yosemite. But unlike before, when she might have clutched at these fragments, she watched them dissolve without resistance. The constant chatter of her mind softened, leaving a profound stillness that was almost tactile.

Tears flowed like morning dew, a natural condensation of something that had always been there, waiting to be recognized and released. The cushion beneath her legs pressed into her skin, a weave of textures that grounded her in this space. The cool air brushed against her damp cheeks, anchoring her as the boundaries between herself and the room shifted, becoming porous.

A shift occurred within her then, as if she had woken up from a sleep she couldn’t remember falling into. The distinct tone she knew indicated the completion of the protocol echoed through the room.

Muffled voices from outside the meditation cell filtered in, sharp and strained. Tim’s voice, so familiar, carried an urgency she hadn’t often heard. Moments later, he appeared in the doorway, his eyes wide and shadowed with worry. He stepped into the room, the tension radiating from him like heat.

“How do you feel?” he asked, crouching down, his voice low but edged with anticipation. His fingers played absently with the loop of meditation beads around his wrist.

Sherry let the question settle into the silence before responding. “I feel awake,” she replied, each word imbued with a truth that resonated in her chest.

Relief flashed across Tim’s face, softening his features for an instant. He glanced over his shoulder, where footsteps echoed in the corridor.

“Meeting in the hall,” he called to the figures waiting outside.

Sherry watched as Zach Goodman strode past, his brow furrowed, tension visible in the tightness of his jaw. Carly Rice followed, clutching her notepad so tightly her knuckles whitened. The energy of their anxiety buzzed at the edge of Sherry’s awareness, sharp and electric, like a storm building on the horizon.

They moved down the hall and around a corner, but she could still make out their voices through the low hum of the servers filling the next room, mingling with the sound of her breath. Her fingers brushed the rough fabric of the cushion, grounding her as the ripples of their departure settled. She sensed the gravity of their meeting, the way their hurried steps and clipped voices had disturbed the room’s stillness.

Time seemed to expand, punctuated only by the rhythmic thrum of the servers in the next room. Dust motes drifted through the thin beam of light filtering from the small, barred window, a reminder of the world beyond unchanged, yet irrevocably altered. Sherry closed her eyes and let her awareness deepen, the calm wrapping around her like a familiar blanket.

“We need guidelines for containment.” She could hear Zach, a distinct worry in his voice. “One success of this algorithm to enlightenment is remarkable. But two? Three? Someone’s going to notice.”

“We’re not stopping,” she heard Tim quickly cut in.

“He’s not saying stop.” Now it was Carly, bringing her familiar calming tone. “He’s saying we need to be smarter. More careful. The moment this gets out…”

“Fine,” Tim said. “Start on it and let me get back to Sherry.”

When Tim returned, the weight of the meeting was etched into the lines of his face. He moved with deliberate steps, settling across from her. His eyes, still searching, met hers with a mix of awe and fear.

“We’ve turned the wheel of dharma,” he said, voice trembling with reverence and doubt. “This changes everything.”

Sherry regarded him, the flicker of fear beneath his excitement even clearer to her now. A wave of compassion swelled in her chest. He was still seeking, grasping for the security of answers. But she no longer needed that certainty. There was only the awareness, vast and serene.

“I am struck by your extraordinary radiance and peaceful presence,” Tim said—practiced words she realized—a quote. The hint of a smile crept across his face, breaking through his tension.

The words touched her, but they passed through her awareness like a ripple on a pond. “It is no different, yet completely different,” she said after a moment. “I see the same objects, the same colors, even seem to have the same thoughts, like recognizing your quote.”

Tim’s expression shifted, a glimmer of understanding dawning.

Sherry’s gaze swept the room, taking in the familiar shapes that now seemed charged with new clarity. “Yet there is an immediacy, a vividness, a clarity… not in the things themselves, but in my perception of them.”

For a moment, Tim’s eyes reflected the enormity of what this meant, the millions of lives that could be touched and changed. The responsibility loomed, and she saw the tremor of doubt return.

“Everything changes, Tim,” she whispered, the words an echo of truth. “The goal is to awaken to that truth.”

He nodded, the tension in his posture easing as understanding settled over him. She was referring to the concept of impermanence. “The protocol will need looking after,” he said, almost as if to himself. “To continue, to develop, to share…”

[SCENE: CH01_S02 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

The hum of servers from the next room seemed to pulse with his racing thoughts. He pressed his thumb against his deceased brother’s meditation beads, the familiar grain of wood anchoring him as Zach’s footsteps approached again, sharp against the floor.

“She’s still stable?” Zach’s voice searched for something measurable. Sherry heard the edge of fear beneath the technical question.

“She’s awake,” Tim corrected, not turning to look at him.

Carly moved into the room, her administrative confidence faltering. “The first successful trial,” she said, clutching her notepad like a shield. “We need guidelines, protocols for…”

“Protocols?” Tim interjected, a sharp laugh that escaped him. “We’ve turned consciousness itself into code, and you want a policy manual?”

“The brain scans are clear,” Zach pressed on, his voice tight with nervous energy. He moved to Tim’s right, tablet in hand. “Neural plasticity off the charts, default mode network showing unprecedented…”

“Look at her,” Tim cut in. Sherry sensed Zach stiffen beside him. “Really look. Do you need a scan to tell you what’s happened? She is a completely enlightened being. A Buddha.”

Sherry sat unmoving, but her presence filled the room like light filling a dark space. Even the air seemed to breathe differently around her.

“We need to document everything,” Carly said, but her voice had lost its administrative edge. “The next participant…”

“Will be here tomorrow,” Tim finished. “And the next soon after. And the next…” The words trailed off, a weight settling over the room.

Zach’s sharp intake of breath carried all his terror of uncontrolled variables. “Tim, we can’t just…”

“Can’t just what?” Tim turned to face him. “Can’t just let people wake up? Can’t just show them what’s real?” His voice cracked on the last word. “Tell me, how many more Michaels do we need before it’s worth the risk?”

Sherry’s voice, when it came, cut through the tension like a knife through fog. “The dharma will find its way.” Six simple words, but they carried the weight of certainty.

Zach and Carly exchanged glances. Sherry experienced the current of their anxiety against her stillness. The protocol was working. That was the miracle and the terror of it for them. Everything they’d theorized, everything they’d coded and tested and feared, was sitting before them in human form, and it was her.

“The retreat center can’t handle this,” Zach muttered, his hand running through his hair. “One success we could contain, but if we run more trials…”

“Trials?” the edge was apparent in Tim’s voice. “Is that what we’re calling it now? Clinical trials for the end of suffering?” His brother’s beads clicked softly between his fingers, a sound that Sherry sensed used to bring comfort but was now feeling like a countdown.

“Two more candidates are ready,” Carly said.

“My brother Michael would have been first in line,” Tim said softly, the words seeming to escape before he could catch them. “He would have…” But he couldn’t finish.

“He would have understood,” Zach filled the silence, his voice gentler than Sherry had ever heard it. “The risks, the potential consequences, he would have said they were worth it.”

“Would he? Or am I just telling myself that to justify what we’re about to do?” Tim looked up, meeting their eyes one by one. “Because let’s be clear, we’re not just running more ‘trials.’ We’re about to break open the world.”

“The quantum processors are stable,” Zach said, falling back on technical certainty. “The neural interface is cleaner than anything we’ve seen. The AI learning curves…”

“Where in the code,” Tim cut in, his voice rising, “did we account for this?” He gestured toward Sherry. “Is there a function for dissolving everything a person thinks they are?”

Sherry contemplated this, there was a wider gulf than Tim knew between the thoughts of who one was and the dissolution of that self.

Tim’s brother’s beads clicked softly as he stood. “I need to check on the figures, then help Zach with the final calibrations for tomorrow.”

Carly responded quietly as she and Zach walked out.

[SCENE: CH01_S03 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

“They’re terrified,” Tim said, settling back onto the cushion across from her. “Not of getting caught. Not of the technical risks. They’re terrified of exactly what they say they want.”

“Like you. You’re holding so tight,” Sherry continued. Not a criticism, not a suggestion to let go. Just a clear seeing aimed to strip away all his defenses.

“Someone has to,” Tim said, but even as the words left his mouth, she recognized their emptiness. “Someone has to…” He trailed off. “My brother died looking for this. He died trying to find what you’re sitting in right now.” His voice cracked. “He died still searching.”

“And now you’re afraid,” Sherry said, her words like light through fog, “that if you really look, if you really see what we’ve built, you’ll have to face that it was always this simple. That he didn’t have to die searching.”

“How do I…” he started, his voice barely a whisper. “How do I keep running this program, keep watching it work, keep sending people through that door, knowing…” The rest of the sentence dissolved into a sob he apparently couldn’t contain.

“Knowing I could have saved him,” Tim finally managed, the words scraping from his throat raw. “Knowing if I’d just figured it out sooner, coded faster, seen clearer…” His hands clutched Michael’s beads so tight the pattern pressed into his palm. “Knowing he died right here in this building, searching for what we’ve turned into ones and zeros.”

“You’re still searching,” Sherry said.

“I don’t know how to do this,” Tim said, in what Sherry knew was a confession.

“The dharma will find its way,” Sherry repeated, her voice steady, as certain as the pull of gravity or a heartbeat.

“He tried to tell me,” Tim whispered, his voice rough. “At the end, when the drugs weren’t working anymore, when meditation wasn’t enough… He said, ‘Timmy, it’s right here. It’s always been right here.’”

“We built this whole machine,” Tim said, gesturing at the headset, “to show people what they already are. Quantum mechanics, neural interfaces, AI, it all sounds, but it’s just a mirror.”

“How many lines of code?” Tim asked, his voice cracking. “How many thousands of lines just to… to…” His hand trembled over the headset. “Just to make it impossible to look away anymore? To force people to see what’s been staring them in the face their whole lives.”

Sherry remained motionless, just being in this moment with her friend. She noticed a new faculty within her. She made her presence expand, holding space for this terrible understanding.

“We turned consciousness into a code,” Tim continued, “using algorithms to mirror what meditation and sacred rituals have done for ages. AI now guides people to the doorway my brother tried so hard to reach.”

“Is this what everyone’s going to see?” he asked, his voice barely audible. “When they put on the headset? When the quantum processors spin up and the AI guides them through? Are they all going to see what a cosmic joke this is? That we built the most advanced technology in human history just to…”

Sherry saw into Tim then, with that faltering question, as she saw into every corner of the meditation cell, every shadow of every light thrown about the space, every texture of every piece of clothing she wore. She knew he didn’t want an answer.

“Let’s meditate awhile,” she said, adjusting her posture. The invitation needed no further explanation. Tim’s breath caught before he exhaled, settling into the stillness with her as the light shifted, touching the room with a quiet, awakened presence.

=== CHAPTER 02 ===

[SCENE: CH02_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Hull's Bar]

Freeman “Bud” Turner, Director of Government Relations and Community Engagement. The new title resonated in his mind. He handed out another card. Around him, friends and colleagues gathered at the end of the bar, exchanging laughter and clinking glasses.

Hull’s bar teemed with energy, unusually busy for a Sunday. It was the type of place where professionals brought clients for dinner or stopped by for drinks after work, hoping to run into familiar faces in government, finance and industry. For Bud, Hull’s wasn’t just a favorite spot; it was where business truly got done. It made sense that he was here, celebrating his promotion.

Bud worked for one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies. With the promotion, he now oversaw how it engaged with local communities and governments, from neighborhood associations to Congress.

Years of navigating bureaucracies and administrations had equipped him well. With a master’s in public affairs and a law degree under his belt, he knew his sharp mind and quick wit made him stand out. Most people seemed to genuinely like him. That last trait was especially useful. Bud’s natural charisma and genuine interest in others made him persuasive in a way that seemed effortless.

“Congratulations, Director of Government Relations,” Frank O’Hearn said, clinking his glass against Bud’s with a knowing smile.

Bud’s eyes narrowed. When a Board Chairman from a competing company sought him out at Hull’s, it was rarely a coincidence.

“Thanks, Frank,” Bud said, studying the older man’s expression as he sipped his drink.

Frank’s smile hardened at the edges. “Though I’m afraid your first challenge just landed on your desk.”

Bud tilted his head, feeling a prickle of apprehension. Years in tech regulation had taught him to listen when someone like Frank spoke.

“The World Health Organization is pushing for neural interface regulations,” Frank continued. “Some bureaucrats in Geneva convinced half the city that consciousness-altering technology needs oversight before it even exists.” He let out a dry laugh. “I trust you’ll help them see how… premature that would be, for the sake of both our companies?”

Bud’s smile was automatic, though unease coiled inside him. “Of course,” he replied, filing the information away as Frank’s intensity lingered in the air. The industry’s worst fears often came before major leaps in innovation. “Why the urgency for regulation?” he added, unable to ignore the feeling that he was missing a piece of the puzzle.

Frank’s hand clapped down on Bud’s shoulder, firm but brief. “Let’s just say I’ve seen some interesting patent applications lately. We can’t let bureaucrats strangle innovation in its cradle.” With that, Frank melted back into the crowd.

Bud exhaled slowly, his mind already tracing the threads of influence he’d need to pull to kill regulations like these. But even as he mapped out phone calls and strategy, an itch of doubt lingered. Why was Frank so invested? Although the entire industry could be effected by the regulations, the man rarely concerned himself with routine regulation battles.

Cheryl appeared at his side, glass raised. “To you,” she said, eyes twinkling.

Bud’s chest warmed at her presence, and he slipped an arm around her waist. “And to my wife,” he added, raising his own glass, “who helped me reach where I am today and makes every success worth it.”

The room hummed with laughter and cheer as Bud kissed Cheryl’s temple. Her smile transported him to a place where the noise and the pressures melted away, leaving only the two of them in a perfect, unbroken moment. He whispered, “I love you,” before they parted to continue mingling, the night unfolding in its usual whirl of conversation and clinks of glass.

[SCENE: CH02_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Hull's Bar]

“Hey, what’s new?” Joe, a programmer from O’Hearn’s company, asked, sidling up with an easy grin. Bud had come to appreciate Joe’s sharp mind and dry humor during joint projects funding tech classes at state universities.

Bud smirked, swirling his drink. “Your chairman just all but assigned me a task like I report to him.”

Joe’s eyebrows shot up. “Frank? Is it the neural interface stuff?”

Bud nodded, the tension from earlier returning. “Yeah, and it feels bigger than my new job title.”

Joe leaned in, voice dropping. “Wouldn’t be surprised. One of our execs was asking about regulations and platform bans, domestic stuff, if you catch my drift.”

The unease in Bud’s gut deepened. “Let’s grab coffee tomorrow. We should talk more.”

Joe nodded, raising his glass in agreement. “Congratulations, Bud. They’re lucky to have you.”

“They sure are,” Bud said with a smile, setting down his empty glass and signaling the bartender. “Seltzer, please.”

Eric, the regular bartender, filled the glass and leaned in, a teasing glint in his eye.

[SCENE: CH02_S03 | POV: Bud | Location: Walk Home]

As Bud walked home that night, the excitement of the evening softened into quiet contemplation. The cool air carried the scent of rain, and his mind drifted to Cheryl as she walked beside him. She’d been different lately, more centered since she started those mindfulness classes. He’d been skeptical when her doctor suggested meditation for stress, but the change was undeniable.

Frank’s cryptic comments, together with Joe’s hints about regulations, stirred something in Bud. Pushing back against regulations was second nature to him. “The future’s coming whether we’re ready or not,” he often told legislators. But lately, he questioned his reflexive stance on regulation.

Cheryl had pointed it out last week. “Not everything needs disrupting,” she’d said, leaning over the kitchen counter after one of his tirades. “Sometimes slow and steady wins the race.”

He’d laughed it off, but her words gnawed at him now. It could be that Joe’s comments bothered him. They poked at the comfort he found in certainty.

Bud shook his head, pushing away the doubt. He had a job to do, interests to protect. But tonight’s conversation had left a sliver of unease that he couldn’t shake.

[SCENE: CH02_S04 | POV: Bud | Location: Coffee Shop]

The next morning, Bud’s unease grew as he approached the coffee shop where he’d agreed to meet Joe. The early chill bit at his neck, but he ignored it, quickening his step. His mind replayed the snippets of conversation from the night before, looking for what was gnawing at him.

Spotting Joe at their usual table, the farthest in the corner, Bud felt a flicker of relief. Joe raised two cups, signaling he’d already ordered for them.

“Joe,” Bud called, stepping over the small fence to avoid walking through the crowded shop. “You’ve got my attention.”

Joe placed Bud’s coffee in front of him, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. “I figured.”

Bud took a sip, savoring the rich, nutty flavor. The warmth slid to his core, a brief reprieve from the buzzing questions in his head. “So, what’s this all about?” he asked, keeping his tone light.

Joe’s grin was fleeting. “One of our mid-level execs was poking around, asking if any past projects were shelved because of platform bans.”

Bud’s brow furrowed. “Sounded official?”

Joe shook his head. “If it were, we’d hear from HR or Legal first. This felt… different.”

“Were there any?” Bud asked, leaning in.

“I don’t know,” Joe admitted, finishing his coffee. “But the way he asked, like he knew something. And then there’s the chatter about neural interfacing.”

“Chatter?” Bud’s pulse quickened.

Joe’s eyes darkened, a rare seriousness replacing his usual levity. “This executive is an AI expert, Bud. If he’s concerned, we should be too. Could the WHO really ban a program outright?”

Bud’s mouth set in a firm line. “They could try. We’d fight it, of course.” He gave a tight smile, but his mind raced. “This suit got a name?”

Joe hesitated before leaning in. “Zach Goodman.”

[SCENE: CH02_S05 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

That night, Bud leaned back into the patio chair and looked out at the stars over his backyard. The cool air carried the scent of freshly cut grass, mingled with the rich aroma of his cigar. The fall evening was crisp, perfect. He let the silence settle over him, a brief respite from the buzzing questions in his mind. Cheryl sat nearby, curled up with her glass of wine. She glanced at him, her eyes softening as they met his.

“Penny for your thoughts?” she asked, her voice breaking the quiet.

Bud chuckled, turning to face her. “They don’t come that cheap,” he teased, with a laugh that sounded less heavy than he anticipated.

“Inflation,” she joked, shifting to face him more fully, the glass resting against her lips before she took a small sip.

Bud’s smile lingered as he looked at her, but the weight of the day pressed back into his chest. “I was just thinking about how lucky I am, this house, this life, you.”

Cheryl’s eyes narrowed playfully,. “You work hard for all this,” she said, tilting her head. “But you’re still thinking about something else.”

Bud exhaled, conceding with a nod. “I was wondering, what if the legislature tried to ban the new AI virtual reality platform?”

Her brow furrowed as she set her glass down. “You’d be able to stop them, wouldn’t you?”

A flicker of doubt crossed his mind, but he pushed it aside. “Of course. But what if I couldn’t? What if it went further, making it illegal to even own a headset?”

Cheryl’s lips parted as she considered the question. “They could stop imports, halt sales. But why would they?” She watched him closely, curiosity mixed with concern.

“I don’t know,” Bud said. “It seems far-fetched, but with neural interfaces, anything feels possible.”

She leaned closer, her eyes steady and confident. “If anyone could stop the government from doing something that drastic, it’s you,” she said, her voice unwavering.

A soft smile pulled at his lips as he met her gaze. “Yeah,” he murmured, letting the tension ease slightly. He looked back out at the stars, the endless sky seeming to stretch out with possibilities he couldn’t quite grasp. He pushed the thoughts aside, leaning over to kiss her, the warmth of her touch grounding him. “I guess you’re right.”

“Of course I am,” Cheryl said, a playful smile lighting her face. “I’m your wife. Now, how about some neural interfacing of our own, Mr. Director?”

=== CHAPTER 03 ===

[SCENE: CH03_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Retreat Center]

After lunch, Tim swung by the retreat center and found Zach bent over his desk, surrounded by scattered papers and schematics. Tim leaned against the edge of the desk, arms crossed, eyes scanning the disarray. Tension twisted in his chest; Zach looked worn out, his face marked by lines of fatigue. The silence between them was taut, their earlier conversation about the future of the protocol having stalled. Neither wanted to confront the fears simmering unspoken.

“We’re close,” Tim said quietly, his voice carrying the weight of exhaustion that clung to him like a shadow. His gaze shifted to the meditation mala beads on the desk, Michael’s beads. They seemed to pulse with unspoken memories. “But every time I think about what comes next… I just can’t shake this feeling.” His voice wavered, and he glanced at Zach before his eyes settled on the beads again. “I keep thinking about Michael.”

Zach’s head snapped up, “Tim…”

Tim swallowed hard, the familiar pressure of grief threatening to surface. “He came here at the end, you know, before the overdose. He was trying so hard to find peace. I thought I could help him. I thought meditation and everything I’d learned would be enough to pull him back from that darkness.” His voice cracked, and he blinked against the sting in his eyes. “But it wasn’t. I wasn’t enough.”

The air between them shifted, the pain palpable. Zach’s expression softened, guilt gnawing at Tim’s gut as he caught the empathy in Zach’s eyes. “You can’t blame yourself for that,” Zach said, his voice low and steady. “You did everything you could.”

Tim’s throat tightened, and he shook his head. Vision clouded with memories and what-ifs. “But what if the protocol had been there then? What if I’d found the key sooner? He could have been saved. This headset could have burned through all that karma weighing him down. He’d still be here.” The ache in his chest surged, raw and unforgiving.

Zach leaned forward, and Tim caught the way his friend’s shoulders tensed, as if holding back his own memories. “I get it,” Zach said, a tremor breaking through the calm in his voice. “I’ve lost people too. Friends. Colleagues. Some to their own battles, others to the obsession with work. This thing we’re creating, it’s powerful. But I don’t want it to cost us more lives. I don’t want to lose anyone else to it.”

The room seemed smaller, the silence between them became heavier. Tim looked down, his voice barely a whisper. “I don’t want to lose anyone either.”

For the first time, the silence seemed to bridge the distance between them, shared regrets weaving through the unspoken pain. The enormity of what they had accomplished loomed in Tim’s mind, no longer just about the groundbreaking technology but the people they had cherished and lost, and the ones they still had a chance to save.

[SCENE: CH03_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Tim's Apartment]

That night, Tim opened his apartment door to welcome Finn. He glanced at the clock; it was just past seven. The living room, filled with stacks of books and research papers, felt smaller than usual with the extra company. Finn had been at his side since the first prototype, so he knew what to expect. But tonight, Jessica, a former co-worker of Tim’s who moved up from that coffee shop to start policy work for the local state senator, was going to join them.

Tim stood by the makeshift whiteboard leaning against the wall, his fingers brushing the dry-erase marker as he took a breath. “We went with the assumption that the ideas behind the Buddhist scriptures on enlightenment were scientific, not just religious. Luckily, centuries of work had been done secularizing those texts to strip away the layers of cultural and religious interpretations. Take the term ‘enlightenment,’ for example.”

“Nirvana,” Jessica blurted, shifting restlessly.

“Exactly,” Tim said, a hint of a smile forming. “Can I give you a quick lecture, to help explain? There are countless interpretations of what that term means, shaped by local beliefs and customs from the time of the Buddha and those who followed. But scientifically, in modern language, what does it really mean?” He paused, letting the question hang in the air. “We needed to define what we were asking our program to help us achieve, or so we thought. The truth was, none of us knew from firsthand experience what that state of mind looked like. There was no definitive brain scan that could guide us, no map to enlightenment. We were navigating blind.”

Jessica tilted her head, a spark of intrigue lighting her expression. “So, what did you do?” she asked, her voice soft but eager.

Tim’s mouth tightened with a blend of pride and uncertainty, recalling those early days. “We approached the problem differently. Instead of trying to define enlightenment, we focused on the steps to get there. Ancient Buddhist texts provide detailed meditation instructions that supposedly lead to enlightenment. So we programmed those instructions into our AI system. The AI guides users through these meditation practices in virtual reality. Our hope was simple: if someone completes all the prescribed steps in VR, they’d achieve what the texts promised—enlightenment—even though we couldn’t scientifically define what enlightenment actually is.”

The room fell silent as Tim’s words settled over them. He glanced at Jessica, noting the way her fingers absently traced the seam of the couch, her mind clearly racing with thoughts. She sat back; eyes fixed on the whiteboard as if searching for the missing pieces.

“Ah,” Jessica said, the word drawn-out as if she understood, though Tim could tell from the confused furrow in her brow that she didn’t. Finn looked on knowingly, having worked through these problems with Tim and the others in the Protocol’s development.

Tim leaned back slightly, drawing a deep breath to steady himself before explaining further. “Let’s put it this way,” he said. Throughout your life, you build up mental patterns that shape how you see everything. The VR program unravels these patterns one by one, showing you that what you thought was real, your thoughts, feelings, and even what your senses tell you, are actually just illusions.

He paused, catching Jessica’s eyes, which were now wide with interest. “It’s one thing to read or be told that these things are empty of independent existence, to think you understand it in theory. But it’s another to truly experience and internalize it at the most fundamental level.”

Jessica leaned forward, a question on her lips. “How exactly does this protocol work?”

Tim’s lips curled into a subtle smile as he straightened his posture, chest expanding slightly. His fingers tapped a quick, eager rhythm against his thigh while his eyes remained fixed on the door, waiting. He nodded slightly. “Great question. The AI acts as a guide that adapts to each user’s unique brain activity. It’s like having a personal meditation coach that learns from your patterns and adjusts its methods as you progress. It fine-tunes its guidance as you move deeper into awareness, similar to how a meditation teacher might customize their lessons based on a student’s development.”

Jessica’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, a crease forming on her brow. “You mean it actually changes the brain’s structure and function?”

Tim met her gaze and nodded. “Precisely. The protocol doesn’t ‘zap’ the brain. It helps guide users through mental patterns, like a meditation teacher would.” He paused for a moment, searching for the right metaphor and settling on one that had resonated with others before. “Think of it as a GPS for the mind. It maps out your mental roads and helps you navigate through the patterns you’ve been conditioned to follow, guiding you to your destination. It doesn’t change your mind; it shows you how to find the way on your own terms.”

Tim watched as Jessica’s fingers tapped lightly against her knee, her mind clearly processing what he had said. The quiet hum of thought in the room was nearly tangible, and he allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. This was the beginning of understanding.

“So, it’s like… an algorithm to enlightenment?” she asked, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and skepticism.

Tim nodded, liking the ring to her statement. “Exactly. It guides users step-by-step, like a teacher, only faster. The practical benefit is that it helps people break free from destructive thought patterns that cause real suffering. Users report reduced anxiety, clearer decision-making, and more meaningful relationships within weeks, not the years or decades traditional practices might take.”

Her brow furrowed again, doubt crossing her face. “Wait. Aren’t you tied to the results of your bad karma? The program lets you escape the consequences of your actions?”

Tim met her eyes, his expression firm. “No, that would be impossible,” he said, his voice steady, carrying the weight of countless conversations like this one. “Externally, your actions have already set into motion the energy needed to create their consequences. This isn’t about erasing what’s been done. What the protocol does is address the problem at its root. Take, for instance, the damage you might have done to yourself through unhealthy habits. You’ll still face the physical repercussions, but your future reactions to that pain will be skillful, preventing further karma from being created. A smoker’s lungs would not be miraculously cured, but the craving to smoke would be rooted out. It all happens at the deepest level of awareness.”

He noticed Jessica’s eyes widen slightly, gears of comprehension turning. “Fascinating. So, by stripping away this illusion of a separate self, the protocol allows people to directly experience reality in a new way?” she asked curiously.

“Exactly,” Tim nodded, the resonance of her understanding reaching him. “The goal is to provide an unfiltered, firsthand grasp of the impermanence and interdependence of your thoughts, emotions and senses. It’s a profound shift in how you perceive everything.”

A pause settled over the room, heavy with contemplation. Tim’s gaze drifted to Finn, who leaned forward, his eyes lit with a familiarity. Finn cleared his throat and spoke up, his voice carrying a practiced calm. “When I practiced insight meditation, I would scan my body for sensations, training myself little by little to stop identifying with them. Like when my knee ached from sitting too long. My brain would immediately label that pain as mine, sparking aversion and breaking my concentration, forcing me to shift and disrupt my focus. But eventually, I learned to just be aware of the pain, detached from it. It wasn’t mine; it wasn’t inherently good or bad. It simply existed. That allowed me to continue moving my awareness elsewhere, down to my toes or up to my head, without losing my composure.”

Tim listened, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Finn’s explanation captured what he had spent so long trying to convey, and for a moment, the room felt unified in shared understanding.

“The next realization was that the pain itself had no inherent existence,” Finn continued, his words tumbled out faster as he spoke, eyes widening. He leaned forward, the pitch of his voice climbed higher on key phrases, and he barely paused for breath between sentences. Tim’s eyes flicked to Finn, appreciating how he brought energy into the room. “Imagine that. It would arise and disappear depending on conditions that were set long before I even sat down to meditate.”

Tim nodded, the connection between their thoughts seamless. “Exactly. So, if you’d hurt your leg as a child, the protocol wouldn’t heal the old wound, but it would help you fundamentally change your understanding and reaction to similar pain in the future” Tim said, his tone softening with emphasis. “Enlightenment isn’t about becoming immune to pain or joy but being truly aware of them and recognizing their true nature.”

Finn leaned in, eyes glinting. “Yes, and don’t forget, joy can be just as distracting as pain. It’s just as empty, just as fleeting.”

Tim glanced at Jessica, seeing the flicker of understanding on her face. He took a breath and continued, “Which brings us to a challenge the Buddha himself pointed out in his time. It’s a challenge just as relevant now, if not more so. This truth is subtle, deep, and difficult to fully grasp, while his generation, and ours, revels in sensory pleasures.”

Finn raised an eyebrow. “And that was before television, commercials, the internet and virtual reality.”

Tim allowed a small chuckle to escape. Jessica’s expression grew contemplative, and she finally spoke, “We have no chance of internalizing this without the protocol.”

Tim’s smile faded, replaced by a thoughtful look. “Probably not,” he admitted, a hint of weariness seeping into his voice. “Although, throughout the centuries, who knows how many reached enlightenment and, out of sheer frustration, chose not to teach what they discovered.” He paused, looking from face-to-face, sensing the shared curiosity. “But now, with the science and technology humanity has built over millennia in our quest for worldly pleasures, each of us has a chance, if we’re willing, to awaken. To live the remainder of our lives free from suffering.”

The silence that followed was almost reverent, Jessica absorbing Tim’s words in her own way. The weight of possibility hung in the room, and for a moment, Tim perceived the quiet hum of hope, a small, persistent note that resonated through them all.

[SCENE: CH03_S03 | POV: Tim | Location: Tim's Apartment]

Later that evening, after Finn and John had left, Tim sat in a plastic chair on the fire escape, the metal cool against his legs. The city hummed softly beneath them, and Jessica leaned over the railing, exhaling a deep sigh into the crisp night air. Tim glanced up at the moon, luminous and watchful, though the streetlights washed out the stars.

“I don’t know that I’m ready for enlightenment,” Jessica said suddenly, turning to meet Tim’s eyes. The streetlamp cast sharp shadows across her face, making her expression seem more vulnerable. “But I’m surprised you haven’t already gone through the protocol.”

Tim shifted, the chair creaking beneath him. “I’m not ready either,” he admitted, the words heavy on his tongue. “Probably for different reasons, though.”

A smirk broke across Jessica’s face. “I still fancy myself a woman with much trouble to get up to.”

Tim let out a short laugh, warmth breaking through the seriousness. “One of the many things I like about you, Jessica.” He stood, stretching his arms and nodding toward the window. “Come on. I want to show you something.”

They stepped back into the dimly lit apartment, the air warmer and carrying the scent of the books that lined the shelves. Tim picked up a worn book from the coffee table, its spine cracked from years of use and opened to a page. The image seemed to pulse with vibrant colors, a six-armed figure surrounded by flames, dark blue skin, fierce eyes, crowned with skulls, and standing over a crushed figure. Weapons gleamed from each hand, and a necklace of severed heads draped across its chest.

Jessica leaned in, eyes wide. “It’s hideous,” she said, a grin breaking through. “I love it.”

“A dharmapala,” Tim said, running a finger along the edge of the page. “A guardian of the dharma. Fierce, terrifying, but ultimately a protector of the path to enlightenment.” He closed the book gently, looking up at Jessica. “These wrathful deities aren’t evil—they represent the forceful compassion needed to protect wisdom from being corrupted. That’s why I’m not ready for the protocol yet. Do you remember what a bodhisattva is?”

Jessica’s brow furrowed, processing what Tim had just explained about the AI-powered VR system. “A being who forsakes their own enlightenment until everyone else has attained it.”

“Exactly.” Tim nodded, the light catching the silver at his temples. “In Buddhist tradition, a bodhisattva reaches the threshold of complete liberation—what we call Buddhahood—but makes a sacred vow to remain in the cycle of suffering until all sentient beings are free. They could cross over into perfect awakening, but choose to stay behind as guides instead.”

“The path…” Jessica said with newfound understanding. “You’re talking about the protocol, aren’t you? You think it needs protection?”

“It will,” Tim said, tapping the closed cover of the book, the weight of conviction pressing into his chest. “What we’ve created isn’t just technology—it’s a shortcut through millennia of spiritual practice. The protocol can burn through lifetimes of accumulated karma in hours, leaving a person fully awakened. But that kind of power—instant Buddhahood without the gradual tempering of the spiritual path—it could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Or even in well-meaning but unprepared minds.”

Jessica’s eyes widened. “So you’re choosing to be the guardian rather than using it yourself.”

“Someone has to stand at the threshold,” Tim said, his gaze drifting back to the fierce deity on the book’s cover. “Someone who understands both the technology we’ve built and the ancient wisdom it’s based on. And whoever takes on that task will have to be fierce and willing to make difficult decisions about who’s ready and who isn’t. Like the dharmapala.”

Jessica stood up, stretching, and letting out a soft chuckle. “Well, I’m not wearing a necklace of skulls, it’d clash with my blazer,” she joked, a glimmer of lightness returned to her tone. “Give a lady a ride home?”

Tim smiled, the tension in his chest easing just a bit as he grabbed his keys from the table. “Let’s go.”

=== CHAPTER 04 ===

[SCENE: CH04_S01 | POV: Georgia | Location: Jeta's Grove]

That morning, walking the grounds alone, Georgia Sato reached the small pond where her grandfather used to fish. The moon’s reflection wavered on the dark water, catching her eye as she paused. Memories of sitting here as a child, watching him cast his line with serene patience, surfaced unbidden. He never seemed to care whether he caught anything.

“The fish are just an excuse,” he told her once. “The real purpose is to sit quietly and watch your mind.”

She had been too young to understand then. Her father had never understood either, too consumed with building the business empire she now helmed. The estate accounting had valued them at nothing, but to her, they were priceless—a piece of wisdom passed down.

Years of corporate acquisitions, billion-dollar deals, and strategic battles in boardrooms had honed her into a formidable leader. The triumphs were satisfying, but true peace had remained elusive. The ambition that fueled her left no space for contentment. The calm moments with her grandfather and in her meditation practice were elusive now.

Her initial meditation practice had been a simple tool for stress management, fifteen minutes squeezed in after her morning workout, before the first meeting of the day. But recently, those moments had taken on a different tone. The same sharp mind that parsed corporate balance sheets now turned inward, dissecting the very foundation she’d built her life upon. She wondered how long she could keep walking both paths. It was becoming more apparent she would have to either choose the path of enlightenment or the path of worldly pleasures.

“Proper temple offerings can generate great merit,” her grandfather’s voice echoed in her mind. “But true merit comes from helping others find the path.”

She had always assumed he spoke of his donations to the Pure Land temples. Those gestures she’d admired but never deeply questioned. Now, as she watched the moon’s reflection fracture on the water’s surface, she wondered if his words had held another meaning, one she may have been blind to.

Georgia returned the beads to her pocket, their weight grounding her as she stood. The tailored lines of her designer suit seemed almost absurd against the simplicity of the scene. In the corporate world, she was known as a force, brilliant, uncompromising, always in control. Yet none of them knew of the doubts that gnawed at her, the growing suspicion that her achievements were just another layer of suffering. The question that had begun to haunt her surfaced again: what if all her power and resources could be repurposed for something beyond wealth?

Her gaze drifted back to the main house, where Ed and the others stood on the porch, their laughter reaching her faintly in the breeze. That familiar tangle of envy and yearning twisted in her chest. They had found the answer her grandfather had hinted at, the one she had been skirting all her life. The question remained—was she ready to search for it herself?

“I heard you made your money the old-fashioned way, Georgia,” Tim said, his grin warm as she stepped onto the porch.

Georgia took in the scene, a familiar space filled with trusted faces, and met his eyes, her own smile controlled. The breeze tugged gently at her long, straight black hair, which she wore down her back. Her button nose crinkled slightly as she responded, and her hazel eyes, sharp with experience, met his.

“Yes, yes, I inherited it,” she replied, her tone light but layered. “But my real work has been in managing it, and at that, I have excelled.” Her gaze drifted over the others, seven in total, seated comfortably as they looked out at the lush field that rolled into the forest’s edge. This land had belonged to her grandfather, who had spent his final years tending to it, a simple life reminiscent of his youth in Japan.

He had named it Jeta’s Grove, explaining to her more than once the story of the businessman who had gifted land and a monastery to the Buddha and his followers. The name had always resonated with her. Unlike her grandfather, who had devotedly funded Pure Land temples across San Francisco and beyond, her father had shed much of that religious commitment when they left California during her childhood.

Georgia leaned back, watching the others as they relaxed on the porch.

Funding the protocol had been a calculated risk, one she took without expecting results. Yet the changes she saw in those who had undergone it, especially Ed, who she’d known for years, had shaken her. The man who now sat before them seemed both familiar and profoundly transformed.

“We have a while before lunch will be ready,” she said, pushing aside the tangle of thoughts and settling into one of the rocking chairs. She glanced at Ed, her tone light but inviting. “Would you share some thoughts in the meantime?”

Ed’s smile was subtle as he nodded, shifting his chair slightly to better face the group. He didn’t stand; there was no need. His presence commanded attention effortlessly. Georgia noted the small audience, Tim, Sarah and a few others from the retreat center, plus two workers who had joined them for a brief respite before the meal. The morning sunlight bathed them all in a warm glow, casting soft shadows that danced across the porch.

“Of course, Georgia, of course,” Ed began, his gaze moving gently across each face. To Georgia, he was the same man she’d always known, yet utterly changed. The furrows that once marked his face with worry had smoothed, and the restless energy she remembered was gone. Instead, he radiated a calm so deep, it was almost tangible. Georgia felt an ache in her chest, she wanted that peace, needed it in a way she could scarcely admit.

“I am humbled by Georgia’s offer of residence here at her Jeta’s Grove and grateful to be in the position in my life to accept,” Ed said, his voice resonant and sure. The air seemed to still as he continued. “Many ask me what it is like to be enlightened, and the truth is they…” he paused, his gaze sweeping down the row of listeners, “you… already know.”

Georgia’s breath caught for a moment. Her grandfather’s teachings surfaced in her mind, the Zen proverbs she’d once listened to with the impatience of youth. Ed’s words sounded like an echo of those lessons, but now they resonated differently.

“It really is the breeze on the skin. The earth under our feet,” Ed said, punctuating his point with a couple of light kicks to the porch boards. “It means being fully aware of everything around you without judging it as good or bad. Before, I was a prisoner of my own reactions. Each reaction was based on previous reactions, creating a chain going back so far that I had no hope of breaking free from it. Yet, with a little help,” he added, a playful smile breaking through as he winked, “I was able to break each link in that chain. I could finally see and understand the root causes behind all my unhealthy patterns of thinking and behavior.”

Georgia’s pulse quickened. The simplicity of his words hinted at a deeper transformation. She stilled, wondering what that peace would feel like.

“It was as if I was stuck in the waking moment,” Ed continued, his voice weaving through the stillness, “where one cannot quite discern what is real and what is a remnant of the dream. In shaking the head and rubbing the face, the dream flees, and the light from the bedroom window strikes the eyes and warms the skin, convincing one that yes, now they are fully awake. That is how it is now.”

The metaphor stirred something within Georgia, a yearning for clarity she had never acknowledged. He spoke with calm certainty that resonated deep in her chest, pulling at the questions she kept buried beneath boardroom strategies and asset portfolios.

“After my retirement, with that emptiness of the hours, the emptiness of my house after the loss of my dear wife, I yearned to awaken from that sterile suffering,” Ed said, his gaze meeting hers for a moment. Georgia recognized the longing in his eyes. “Yet I did not know how. I meditated, I bowed, I prayed to the great Amitabha Buddha to deliver me to the Pure Land. I moved to this hermitage. There was utility in this, of course. It helped with my blood pressure. It reminded me to do better, to be kinder, to keep striving. Yet the fuel which kept the fire of my passions fed remained.”

Georgia leaned forward slightly, the porch creaking beneath her as she listened. The restlessness, the striving without ever reaching satisfaction, mirrored the engine that had driven her for so long. She thought of the merger she’d orchestrated last quarter—how the thrill of closing the $4 billion deal had lasted barely a week before her mind was already hunting for the next acquisition. Or the beachfront property in Malibu she’d purchased after three years of negotiations, only to visit twice before the emptiness crept back in. No matter how many companies she added to her portfolio or how many zeros appeared in her net worth, that gnawing sense of “not enough” always returned, pushing her toward the next challenge, the next conquest.

“What kept that fire burning?” Ed’s voice softened. “The fuel was my endless wanting of pleasant experiences, my pushing away of unpleasant ones, and all my judgments about both. As I learned to step back from these reactions, one by one, I could simply be aware without constantly evaluating everything. A deep sense of balance emerged, allowing me to be fully present without being pulled toward pleasure or pushed away from pain. When I stopped adding fuel, the distracting fire naturally went out. That’s when I could truly see the world as it is - how everything connects and flows into everything else without separation. And then I realized my own awareness works the same way. Through directly experiencing this, not just thinking about it, I could see that nothing has a fixed, permanent nature - including myself. The fuel that I thought was necessary was never really there. I’m exactly where I always was, just fully awake to it now.”

Georgia’s mind buzzed with unasked questions as the lunch bell rang, cutting through the spell Ed’s words had cast. The group exchanged bows, murmuring thanks as they rose. Georgia offered Ed a quiet, sincere nod before turning to lead everyone inside.

One of the attendees quickened his pace to catch up with her and chuckled lightly. “Do you think this protocol would alleviate the silent suffering of my mandatory staff meeting tomorrow morning?”

It was a jest, casual and harmless, but it struck a nerve in Georgia. She forced a smile, though her thoughts raced. The young man reminded her of her assistant, the one who had helped install her AI hub and the virtual reality boardroom in her home office. Would her own board meetings feel trivial if she went through the protocol? Would she even care to hold board meetings at all?

The thought expanded, unwelcome and heavy. If she no longer needed to chase success, would her assistant, her secretary or anyone else still have jobs if she suddenly stopped needing anything? The implications coiled inside her, making her fingers tighten around the porch railing until her knuckles whitened. She stood abruptly, her heart racing as scenarios flashed through her mind like warning signals. Just because she stopped needing things didn’t mean others wouldn’t still need to feed their families.

She glanced back at Ed, catching his calm profile as he entered the house the screen door closing with a soft click behind him. This time, she saw him not just as an old friend transformed but as a challenge, a vision of what lay ahead if she dared to follow. Georgia released her grip on the railing and brushed her palms against her tailored slacks, trying to wipe away both the splinters and the sudden doubt.

[SCENE: CH04_S02 | POV: Ed | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Later that evening, as the moonlight wavered over the pond, Ed sat alone, cross-legged on the soft earth near the meditation hall, the faint hum of cicadas weaving through the stillness. His hands rested loosely on his knees, palms open, his breath shallow and quiet. He didn’t need to close his eyes; to him the world was already luminous.

The gravel path leading to Jeta’s Grove glimmered faintly in his mind. He felt its every stone, the air shifting softly over its curves. Somewhere in the distance, a deer paused mid-step, its heartbeat a soft rhythm that blended with his own. The protocol hadn’t erased his senses; it had made them boundless. Everything touched him, not as noise or distraction but as melody.

The fish are just an excuse. He remembered the words from an elder meditator during his first day at the retreat center. The man had smiled when he asked why so many seemed simply to sit by the water. They’re not looking for answers, only reflections.

Now he understood. The protocol had been a mirror, not a revelation. It had shown him the layers of himself he once mistook for walls. Thoughts came and went like ripples on the pond’s surface, barely noticed, until they vanished entirely. What remained was something simpler, something vast: the endless stillness beneath the surface.

His first hours after awakening had been marked by an almost overwhelming clarity, each sensation sharp and profound. Yet, as the days passed, he found himself drawn to silence, not for what it lacked but for what it contained. He spent long hours listening to the way the wind carried voices and to the pause between the questions people didn’t know they were asking.

Ed’s gaze drifted to his reflection in the water, the faint curve of her face visible among the stars scattered across its surface. His image shimmered as the wind shifted. There was no need to steady it. The distortion was no less real than the stillness.

For years, he had chased moments like this, believing enlightenment would feel like a victory, an achievement. Like finishing that marathon in his forties where he’d collapsed at the finish line, gasping but triumphant—the same way he’d pushed through corporate mergers and retirement planning. But there was no finish line here, no medal to hang on the wall. The protocol hadn’t transformed him into something new; it had simply removed the fog he’d been lost in his entire life.. Stepping through had been inevitable, like finally seeing that the door to the room he’d been frantically searching for had been open the whole time. He smiled from the quiet contentment of knowing he had been here all along, wondering how many others would soon discover their own open doors, and what that might mean for a world built on the very fog he’d left behind.

The moon rose higher, its light bending over the pond and the woods beyond. Ed stood slowly, brushing the dust from his hands. He began walking toward the hall, his movements soft but certain. Each step felt both deliberate and incidental, part of a rhythm he neither created nor resisted.

Behind him, the pond stilled again, reflecting the sky with perfect clarity.

=== CHAPTER 05 ===

[SCENE: CH05_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's Office]

He held out for months, but Zach Goodman had finally allowed Bud Turner to secure an appointment on his calendar. Zach hadn’t paid much attention to the noise outside his door until Mark, his reliable gatekeeper, called out, “Mr. Goodman will see you now.” Zach’s gaze flicked to the clock on the wall, marking the time with a resigned nod.

Bud slipped through the door with a practiced smile. Zach’s eyes followed his movements, assessing him as he took a seat. “Mr. Turner,” Zach said, his tone neutral as he pushed aside a draft report, “I hope traffic wasn’t too bad this morning.”

Bud’s response was automatic, and Zach noted the slight uptick in his voice, the kind people use when trying to set a casual tone. “Not at all, I actually came in early to run some errands before heading over, so I missed it today.”

Zach glanced at his sparse, impersonal office before focusing back on Bud. “Nice, always good to avoid rush hour,” he replied, adjusting his posture. “So, there’s a conference coming up, and you couldn’t find anyone at your own shop to talk about artificial intelligence in virtual reality?”

The corners of Bud’s mouth twitched upward. Zach couldn’t help but notice how Bud’s eyes darted around the room, taking in the bare walls and the uncluttered desk. “We don’t want to have all the fun,” Bud replied. His voice was smooth, calculated. “It’s an industry-wide affair, and as I said in my email, I think you are particularly well-suited for this topic.”

Zach’s eyebrow arched slightly, a practiced move. He wasn’t new to flattery, and he met Bud’s eyes with an expression that hinted at skepticism. “Yes, you did say that, but I’ve been scratching my head as to why. I’m just a mid-level manager overseeing the creation of a zebra-themed fitness app.” As far as anyone in his professional life was concerned, that was true.

Bud’s grin widened. Zach noticed how Bud’s hands moved, almost theatrically. “I’m sure it will be a smashing success,” Bud said, his voice laced with good-natured sarcasm. He leaned forward. “But that’s not what you’ll be talking about. You’ll be discussing the effects of over-regulation on innovation.”

The statement hung in the air, Zach’s eyes narrowing slightly as he took it in. His desk’s neatness weighed on him. Bud’s voice cut through Zach’s momentary distraction. “You worked on a medical application that didn’t get off the ground, right?”

Zach’s attention snapped back to the conversation and leaned forward. “Someone’s done their homework,” he said, the tone light but guarded. He adjusted his glasses with a push of his index finger. “But that project wasn’t a casualty of over-regulation. It fell to unprofitability. I’m confident we could have navigated the FDA’s labyrinth, though it would’ve been a nightmare for compliance.”

“Exactly!” Bud interjected. “How many ideas don’t even make it to the boardroom because of compliance?”

Zach chuckled, a dry sound. He felt the tension ease slightly as he leaned back. “If we’re being honest, not nearly as many as the ones that die in sales meetings.”

Bud’s eyes lit up as if a door had cracked open. “Now you’re getting somewhere,” he said. Bud inched forward, his hands clasping together with a muted clap. “What if the FCC or Homeland Security decided to regulate platforms or ban them outright? It happens in other countries. Can you imagine?”

A subtle chill settled over Zach. He didn’t flinch, but the question echoed louder than it should have. He’d asked questions like that himself, though with different intentions. The pause felt heavy, and he forced himself to reply quickly, to control the narrative. “If the FCC or Homeland Security wants to ban Zebra Zoomba, they’re welcome to try,” Zach said, his tone sharper, dismissive. “But I’m not your guy for this topic, Bud. The conversation should be about how over-regulation impacts profitability. Innovation is resilient. Ban something, and people will only want it more.”

Zach kept his expression neutral, but he felt the sharp edge of Bud’s persistence. Bud’s seemingly casual demeanor didn’t fool him; Zach could sense the probing behind those steady eyes. Bud was fishing, and Zach wasn’t entirely sure what he hoped to catch, but Frank’s cryptic remarks from a few weeks ago and Bud’s subtle digs now confirmed that someone had been connecting dots Zach hadn’t even laid out yet. He forced his mind to stay calm, to resist the urge to reveal anything.

“True,” Bud said, leaning back just enough to look relaxed, but not quite enough to fully disengage. “But then our product becomes like drugs were decades ago, bad quality knockoffs no law-abiding citizen can bring to market.”

Zach’s jaw tightened slightly. Bud’s words, delivered with a practiced ease, struck at a nerve, and he couldn’t deny the man’s rhetorical skill.

“This is why you’re exactly the guy for this presentation. Frank mentioned you might be above the fray on topics like this when I pitched it to him. He thought you’d be good for the gig.”

Zach’s eyes narrowed. So, Frank had been in on this. Typical. The sarcasm in his voice came naturally as he replied, “Well, perhaps Chairman O’Hearn would like to give the presentation. He’s got the name recognition.”

He watched Bud take the verbal jab with an almost imperceptible shrug. “Hey, listen,” Bud’s tone shifted, as if revealing a card he’d been holding back. “I ran into him at a trade show while I was trying to get on your schedule, Zach. There’s nothing Machiavellian about this. Like I said in my email, your name came up through the association. I’m tasked with filling these damned slots and making it worth the legislator’s time.”

Zach caught the subtle emphasis on ‘worth,’ another nudge that only someone in Bud’s position would consider innocuous.

“The conference isn’t for another eight months, so there’s no rush. Give it some thought.”

Zach nodded stiffly, but his mind was already racing. He couldn’t help but feel Bud knew something about the protocol. The eight-month timeline was a reprieve, but it wasn’t infinite. Bud stood, hand outstretched. Zach took it, feeling the firm grip that lasted just a beat too long, as if Bud was measuring something unspoken.

As Bud turned and started for the door, he called back over his shoulder, “Why would the government want to ban a virtual reality platform? Think about it.”

The door clicked shut, leaving Zach with the faint echo of that parting question. It settled into his thoughts like a splinter, poking at his carefully constructed calm.

[SCENE: CH05_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's Car]

Driving from the office that night, Zach felt the weight of certainty settle in his chest. He knew exactly why the government would want to ban a virtual reality platform. The retreat center was already abuzz with talk of mass production, and with five headsets now operational, it was only a matter of time before the protocol found its way into the open. The thought made his stomach tighten with worry. Maybe he could use his upcoming speech at the convention to shift attention away from the protocol or even make a case against it? But that would be dangerous. Since he’d be speaking as a representative of his company, everyone would analyze his words carefully—the legal department would review them first, then the association would examine them, and Bud would probably scrutinize every sentence too.

Bud. Something about him didn’t sit right with Zach. On the surface, Bud was the epitome of a genuine guy, earnest and a true believer in technology. But that very sincerity set Zach’s instincts on edge. Why didn’t anyone have anything negative to say about him? Bud had requested this meeting around the time the protocol proved successful, why did the timing of this meeting request line up so conveniently? Zach clenched the steering wheel a bit tighter. He’d pushed off the meeting as long as possible, but Bud’s persistence had been relentless.

He tried to piece it together as the car hummed along. The retreat center was insulated; no one there would know Bud, he reminded himself, aware he was spiraling. But Bud had connections, a web of colleagues and acquaintances. If a hint of the protocol had escaped, a whispered rumor passed from one friend to another, it wouldn’t be implausible for it to find its way to Bud. Especially if someone in his circles thought it interesting enough to mention, even in passing.

Zach’s focus snapped back as he turned into the parking lot of the spa. He exhaled slowly, trying to clear his mind. The phone in the passenger seat caught his eye, and he slid it into his briefcase as the car glided into a spot. He had arrived early for his appointment, but his thoughts refused to relent, circling, and prodding at him as he sat there.

He turned his attention to the technical details of the protocol. He sifted through the complex layers, focusing on how quantum physics affected living brain cells. Suddenly, the design of the protocol snapped into clear focus. He could see it all now like a blueprint spreading out in his mind. This wasn’t just collecting brain data—it was creating a bridge between quantum physics and biology that could maintain special  states in the brain.

The system combined several cutting-edge technologies. It merged regular EEG brain monitoring with quantum sensors to track not just normal brainwaves but also brain activity at the quantum level. Scientists had already mapped meditation states using EEG readings and brain wave patterns, but the protocol went much deeper. It could detect quantum connections in the tiny structures inside neurons. The protocol was mapping a hidden symphony of brain activity that even the top researchers in the field had barely started to understand.

What made it revolutionary was the feedback system. The retinal tracking was observing eye movement and quantum coherence states in the visual cortex. At the same time, it was mapping neural oscillation patterns. It resulted in a wide range of user experiences. Some describing vivid visuals, others distinct sounds, and still others perceiving subtle energy shifts. The variability intrigued him and reinforced that this technology was unprecedented.

He marveled how Buddhism, once dismissed as mere philosophy, served as a precise roadmap for consciousness. The quantum sensors validated those ancient teachings. Charting states of awareness were previously spoken in esoteric terms. This wasn’t manipulation at all. It was the creation of conditions for consciousness to observe itself at the quantum level.

A chill ran down his spine as he thought about the implications. Not everyone was prepared to relinquish those illusions. For those deeply attached to desire and power, the truth the protocol exposed would be terrifying.

His thoughts darkened. This protocol wouldn’t just change how individuals think. It could shake the foundations of a world that runs on buying things and controlling people. He imagined politicians, corporations, and news outlets panicking, their voices rising in alarm. They would call it dangerous—not because it actually was, but because it threatened the systems they depended on. A society freed from endless wanting could tear down the very structures that held our current world together. What scared him most was thinking about the chaos that would come from those who refused to wake up, who would fight desperately to protect their familiar illusions.

The first sting of tears pricked at the corners of Zach’s eyes, but the sudden buzz of his phone from within his briefcase interrupted the moment. His alarm. It was time for his scheduled float in the sensory deprivation tank. This spa boasted the quietest, most comfortable tanks he had ever found, and he often looked forward to the experience, two hours of weightless silence and darkness that unknotted his body and set his mind adrift. But now, as he sat there, the thought gnawed at him. Did he really want to be submerged in that silent, consuming dark, alone with this fear?

=== CHAPTER 06 ===

[SCENE: CH06_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Retreat Center]

The next day, Zach stepped into the office of the retreat building, taking in the familiar scent of aged wood and herbs that always lingered in the air. The building marked the entrance to Jeta’s Grove, set apart from the cluster of hermitage buildings hidden deeper within the forest.

Carly sat at her desk, absorbed in paperwork.

“Got a minute?” Zach asked, lowering himself into a chair opposite her.

“For you, I’ve got a few,” she said with a warm smile, closing the folder she’d been reviewing.

He hesitated. “A couple of things. First, I got an unexpected invitation to give a presentation on the regulation of virtual reality platforms at a conference for legislators.”

She raised an eyebrow, mildly curious. “I can’t say that’s surprising, considering your field.”

“True,” he admitted, shifting his weight slightly. “But it’s the focus that caught me off guard, the potential for government bodies to ban this technology. It felt… oddly specific.”

Carly’s eyes widened, her fingers pausing mid-tap on the desk. “Oddly specific indeed. Plenty of our recruits are or were involved in your industry, so it’s possible someone’s been talking. Oh, and by the way, Modern Meditator Magazine called. They want to write a piece about the protocol. Could there be a connection?”

A faint flush crept up Zach’s neck, an old tell of his when embarrassment struck. “Modern Meditator? How would they even know? Maybe I let something slip during those early trials and recruitment phases.”

“I wouldn’t worry too much,” Carly said, her voice soft but steady. “So, you mentioned you were invited to speak, did you accept?”

He glanced at his hands, the question gnawing at him. “I wasn’t planning to, but now I’m thinking that turning it down might draw more attention than just going through with it. Especially if there’s already potential press coverage,” he said, letting the end of his sentence hang, almost as a question.

If she caught the hesitation, Carly didn’t acknowledge it. Instead, she shifted gears. “You mentioned there was something else?”

Zach’s jaw tightened, a flicker of concern passing through his eyes. “The usual security,” he said. “We need something as basic as a sign-in sheet for the work area downstairs. The more we progress and the more hints we get that people outside know about it, the more on edge I feel.”

“What exactly has you on edge?” Carly asked.

He exhaled,. “We’ve built a solid framework, thanks to Tim, Sarah, and the rest of the team. The way we’re rolling this out, cautiously, with deliberate steps, feels right. But the idea of the tech or the programming slipping off campus, even unintentionally… that’s what keeps me up at night.”

“Zach, you know I share these concerns,” Carly said, leaning forward over the desk, her expression softening into that almost maternal look she sometimes wore. The shift made him feel both comforted and exposed. “But this is a meditation retreat, not a top-secret lab. We’ve kept traffic to the protocol areas minimal, and I trust the intentions of everyone involved in this project.”

“Me too, me too,” Zach said, though the words felt hollow. As he tried to give shape to his fears, they felt increasingly absurd, like shadows stretching too far. He shook his head slightly, clearing his thoughts. “I’m more than nervous, Carly. I’m scared.”

The seriousness in his voice made Carly pause. She stood and came around to sit on the front edge of the desk, so close now that Zach could see the slight lines of worry around her eyes. “What are you scared of?” she asked, leaning in.

He swallowed, feeling the dry tightness in his throat. “I’m scared someone will share the protocol prematurely, for the wrong reasons. I’m scared the world isn’t ready for this.”

She closed her eyes for a moment, then met his gaze. “Look, I get it. But honestly, Zach, when would the world ever be ready for something like this?”

“That’s not…” Zach raked a hand through his hair. “We built this thing, Carly. Us. Don’t we owe it to everyone to make sure they’re prepared before it gets out there?” The words tumbled out, his voice rising. “Before someone gets hurt?”

Carly’s mouth curved into a faint smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Zach, the protocol assists with enlightenment. It isn’t an incurable virus.”

“To us, it isn’t,” he countered. His heartbeat drummed harder. “Everyone here, everyone who worked on it, who programmed and tested it, we all understand it. Enlightenment is a goal we share. But outside this retreat? To people at the local coffee shop, or sitting in church pews, or debating in legislative chambers, it could be seen as a threat. Maybe even worse.” He felt the chill ripple across his skin, leaving goosebumps in its wake.

Carly’s eyes widened for a moment as she took in his expression, truly seeing how unsettled he was. She took a steadying breath before speaking, her tone softer. “We need to take this seriously, Zach. I admit we’ve skirted this issue for too long. While most have exercised caution, some have pushed for broader, faster deployment. I’ll talk to Tim, Sherry, and some of the others to reassess our approach. We’ll consider more discretion and look at bolstering security for the headsets and data.”

Relief washed over him, loosening the tight bands of anxiety around his chest. Zach stood, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding, and bowed slightly. “Thank you, Carly. That’s all I ask, you’re the leader here, people will listen if it comes from you”

“Anytime,” she said, matching his bow with a hint of a smile. “And Zach?”

He paused, hand still hovering over the back of his chair. “Yes?”

“Consider the presentation. It could help the world get ready.”

[SCENE: CH06_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Retreat Center]

In the basement of the retreat center, the low hum of computers pressed into the silence. Zach’s eyes strained as they moved over the lines of code on the protocol’s latest iteration, a familiar anticipation in his chest. Across the room, Tim stood by the window, staring into the night as though searching for answers in the darkness. The unspoken tension between them buzzed like static, sharp and charged. They both knew this confrontation had been coming for days.

“I don’t think you get it, Zach,” Tim said at last, breaking the silence. His voice was calm, but frustration sharpened its edges. “You’re so caught up in the mechanics and the code that you’re missing the point. This isn’t just some new technology, this is the future of human consciousness. Do you even understand what we’ve created?”

Zach’s fingers hesitated over the keyboard, but he kept his gaze fixed on the screen, forcing himself to stay composed. “Of course, I understand,” he muttered, the words tasting bitter. “Well, most of it, maybe not some of Sarah’s code.” He chuckled then got serious again. “I did help build it Tim. But that’s why I’m worried. You talk as if a few enlightened beings are going to save the world.”

Tim’s brow furrowed, his silhouette rigid against the dim glow of the computer monitors. The tension between them thickened as Tim turned, his voice rising with urgency. “This tool can break the cycle of suffering, just as the Buddha taught. And you want to hesitate?”

Zach stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floor, the sound slicing through the room like a reprimand. He forced himself to meet Tim’s gaze, heat flaring in his chest. “What I want,” he said, each word deliberate, “is to be sure we’re not rushing headfirst into disaster. You’re obsessed with ‘turning the wheel of dharma,’ but what about the consequences for society? When society breaks down, or alleviating the suffering of some only makes I grow tenfold for others? What happens then?”

A flash of anger crossed Tim’s eyes, disbelief trailing behind it. “You’re afraid,” he said, the words cutting into the space between them. “Afraid to see that the world is suffering, and we have the power to change that. Hate, war, jealousy, it’s all based on people suffering, and the protocol can end that. Don’t you see what’s at stake here?”

Zach felt his jaw tighten, the muscles straining with the effort to keep his voice controlled. “I do see what’s at stake, Tim. That’s exactly the problem. You’re so focused on saving people from suffering that you’re blind to the greater risks. What if the protocol creates more suffering? What if it fractures society while freeing individuals?”

Tim moved closer, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “This is bigger than either of us, Zach. You know that. We’ve tapped into something… extraordinary. Don’t tell me you can’t feel it.”

Zach’s gaze dropped to the floor, his hands curling into fists as the familiar shiver of unease traveled through him. “I feel it,” he admitted, the confession scraping against his throat. “That’s what disturbs me.”

The room fell silent, the soft hum of the machines enveloping them once more. For a moment, the only sound was the rhythmic ticking of a nearby wall clock, its mechanical heartbeat underscoring their impasse. Then, Tim exhaled, the tension in his stance ebbing slightly. “We can’t afford to be scared now. Not when we’re this close.”

Zach’s shoulders slumped, the fire in his chest flickering as doubt seeped in. “And what if we’re not close enough?”

Tim didn’t answer, only looked at him with eyes that held both challenge and expectation. The room seemed to hold its breath, waiting for Zach to make the choice. Waiting for him to believe.

Just then, the fear that had gripped Zach for months, the fear of unleashing something uncontrollable, gave way to another realization.

If anyone could make sure the protocol worked as intended, it was him. He glanced over at the shelf where the prototype headsets sat, neatly arranged, each one representing years of research and countless sleepless nights. Sherry’s words came back to him: “The dharma will find its way.” But the dharma didn’t write code. It didn’t debug neural feedback loops or calibrate quantum sensors. That was his job.

Tim’s footsteps echoed faintly as he paced toward a window,. Zach turned to him, his decision made.

“You’re right,” Zach finally said, his voice breaking the silence.

Tim stopped, turning to face him.

“You’re right about the protocol,” Zach continued, standing now, his hands braced against the desk. “It’s the future. And I’ve been holding back, not because I don’t believe in it, but because I’m scared of what happens if we screw this up.”

Tim’s expression softened, a flicker of hope flashing in his eyes.

“But here’s the thing,” Zach said, his voice firm now. “If anyone’s going to make sure we don’t screw it up, it’s me. I know the code, the hardware, the risks. I know how to make this work the way it’s supposed to. If I walk away, someone else might rush it, might miss something crucial.”

Tim nodded slowly, understanding dawning on his face.

“So,” Zach said, straightening. “I’m in on moving quicker. Completely, no pauses. But on one condition.”

Tim raised an eyebrow. “What condition?”

“We do it right,” Zach said. “No shortcuts. No rushing at the expense of getting it right. Every headset, every calibration, we double-check everything. We don’t just push this out because we’re excited or desperate. We owe it to everyone who’ll use this to get it right.”

Tim’s lips curled into a small, relieved smile. “Agreed,” he said, holding out his hand.

Zach hesitated for a moment, then clasped Tim’s hand firmly. The weight in his chest didn’t vanish, but it shifted, transforming into a sense of purpose.

As Tim returned to his pacing, Zach sat back down at the computer, his fingers moving across the keyboard with newfound focus. He would take that speaking engagement Bud Turner had offered him. The protocol wasn’t just a tool anymore. It was his responsibility, his chance to turn fear into something meaningful.

And he wasn’t going to let anyone, least of all himself, get in the way of that.

=== CHAPTER 07 ===

[SCENE: CH07_S01 | POV: Georgia | Location: Georgia's Car]

It was late in the evening when Georgia finally bid farewell to the group at Jeta’s Grove and began her drive home. The car chose a route and moved smoothly out of the driveway. After spending a few days at the retreat, she felt a deep sense of renewal, a wave of contentment settling over her.

Her thoughts drifted, as they often did in these moments. She pondered undergoing the protocol herself. What would it mean to step back from her businesses and to hand over their day-to-day operations to trusted associates? Then embrace a simpler existence steeped in meditation. The idea of staying at Jeta’s Grove, learning from Ed and the others, tugged at her mind.

A familiar resistance stirred within her. Some ingrained drive she couldn’t quite name, kept pulling her back to her responsibilities. Managing her interests and occupying her place on various boards gave her satisfaction she couldn’t deny. Even the stress, the moments of anxiety, had become oddly reassuring, a sign of her continued relevance.

The protocol felt like her only chance to untangle the knots she’d allowed to tighten in her life’s fabric. A year ago, the thought wouldn’t have crossed her mind. Back then, if someone had asked where she saw herself in five or ten years, she would have spoken in terms of achievements, status and power. Now, however, she felt a certainty she couldn’t shake: she would reach enlightenment within that timeframe, or sooner.

But the path wasn’t straightforward. Carly’s painstakingly slow and cautious approach to the protocol frustrated her. Her wealth and influence had proven useless in advancing her position on the waiting list. She’d gathered substantial insight into how the center managed this groundbreaking process. Deliberate and meticulous, they permitted only candidates deemed ready, those already detached from worldly attachments, to proceed.

Ed’s face surfaced in her mind, he had been an ideal participant. Retired, rooted in the serenity of the retreat, with no family to tie him down. Georgia considered the others who had undergone the protocol and had a sudden flash of understanding. Were they selecting only those certain to succeed? Could the protocol work for someone like her, tangled in desires, attachments and the complexities of the material world? Would it penetrate the dense layers of karma she had accumulated, even just in this lifetime?

A sigh escaped her lips. She was far from saintly, and she knew it. In a world as unforgiving as this one, purity seemed almost impossible. Generosity was part of her nature, but so was shrewdness, a sharpness honed by years in business. The idea that using her success as a financier to meaningfully alleviate suffering through charity, ethical practices, it felt hollow. She did what she could to minimize harm, balancing her actions with prayer and meditation, yet the question remained: how could she genuinely help anyone else when she herself was so deeply ensnared in the very suffering she wished to transcend?

Tomorrow, she was meeting with Tim at her office.

A flicker of curiosity surfaced as she wondered why Tim had chosen her office for their meeting rather than one of the quiet nooks at Jeta’s Grove. Was he on the cusp of undergoing the protocol himself? Or, she dared to hope, was he about to tell her that she would finally have a chance at it? Whatever the reason, it was a perfect opportunity to seek his insight into her own reflections and questions.

[SCENE: CH07_S02 | POV: Georgia | Location: Georgia's Office]

“Once manufactured, each headset would have the artificial intelligence protocol preloaded onto it before delivery,” Tim said the next day. After six months of successful trials, they were ready for the next step. “The software will be reusable for the life of the hardware, encrypted, including both hard and soft fail-safes to prevent unauthorized modifications or copying.”

Georgia drew in a long breath. “Is this a functional prototype?” she asked, pointing at the sleek headset on her desk.

“Not currently. The hardware is operational, but the artificial intelligence software hasn’t been loaded yet.” Tim’s gaze drifted to the device, a hint of anticipation in his eyes. Georgia knew he fully grasped the magnitude of what they had created. To them, it was nothing less than an algorithm to enlightenment, a path so direct that it banished doubt, leaving only discovery in its wake.

She stood and turned to face the darkened window, the heavy rain drumming against the glass with relentless intensity. The revelation left her reeling. She hadn’t realized the protocol was so close to mass production. But she reminded herself, why would she? The retreat center had kept her at arm’s length, a deliberate exclusion reinforced by the teachers who had joined Tim to guide others after their own experiences with the protocol. A sudden realization sparked her mind.

“Carly doesn’t know you’re here, does she?” Georgia asked, keeping her eyes on the rain-slicked cityscape.

Tim joined her by the window, his silence stretching between them like the dark clouds outside.

“They don’t know you have this prototype, or the protocol either, do they?” she pressed, a note of suspicion sharpening her voice.

Tim’s response came measured and indirect. “Few at the center have been more vocal about caution than I have.”

“What changed?” she turned to face him, searching his expression.

“Jeta’s Grove, what is happening there with the teaching, and those who have gone through the protocol,” he said, his voice softening, eyes glistening with an unspoken emotion. “It showed me that there’s a place in this world for enlightenment. Whether they want to accept it or not, the wheel of dharma is turning, right now.”

“Spinning it too hard might throw it off its axis,” she replied, an eyebrow arching.

“There are enough obstacles in this world, fear, attachment, decadence, comfort, ignorance,” he said, trailing off before refocusing on the prototype. “But lack of access for those seeking liberation shouldn’t be one of them. People have wandered further from the truth of their suffering and the hope of release for too long.”

Georgia sighed and stepped back to her chair, sitting down heavily as if the weight of the decision had already settled on her shoulders. Tim perched on the corner of her desk and picked up the headset, turning it over in his hands. The rain’s tempo seemed to quicken.

“The real innovation isn’t just the hardware,” Tim began, tracing the headset’s sleek curve. “It’s how we solved the quantum decoherence problem.”

Georgia’s brow lifted slightly. “Explain.”

“Most neural tech forces the brain into set states, but this protocol acts as a mirror. It shows you your mind’s own illusions, leaving you to unravel them.”

“And the encryption?” Georgia’s mind shifted to the security implications.

“Multi-layered. The quantum encryption key is partially generated by the user’s own neural patterns. Each unit unhackable. Sarah, one of our coders, embedded the AI’s core algorithms into quantum dots within the processor. They are impossible to copy or modify without destroying them.”

Georgia absorbed the intricacies of the design. This was no ordinary device. This was an intersection of technology and human consciousness. It redefined how minds could perceive themselves.

“And you fit all that into something this compact?” She picked up prototype number five   , feeling the surprising lightness of its frame.

Tim’s face split into a smile. “That was the true engineering hurdle. Stabilizing quantum components at room temperature took us years. But it had to be practical and usable. Otherwise, what’s the point?”

Georgia’s mind shifted into strategy mode. From a logistical standpoint, she could scale this into mass production despite the complexities involved. Finding the right location, sourcing rare materials, hiring a trusted team, it was all possible. Keeping the operation discreet, however, would be a challenge of its own.

The real question, though, wasn’t whether she could do it, but whether she should. She reached out for the headset, noting the number five etched into its side.

“Five prototypes already?” she asked, unable to mask her surprise.

“Yes,” Tim said, taking the headset back. “This is the latest. In the six months since our first successful test, twelve people have reached enlightenment using the first four. This one is up next for testing. They’re all identical, and they all work. We’re ready for mass production.”

“If,” she emphasized, “and I do mean if, we move forward, we can’t do it here.”

Tim’s expression brightened with a touch of hope. “There’s always the old bunker.”

“It’s not equipped for this kind of work, and it’s been sealed for so long that finding the entrance might be impossible. We need a proper warehouse. If we do this, it’ll require space, power and a team to make it happen.”

=== CHAPTER 08 ===

[SCENE: CH08_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Coffee Shop]

Bud Turner glanced down at his phone to check his messages. “I’m in to speak if there is still a slot open.” The brief text from Zach Goodman stood out, stark against the screen’s light. Bud blinked, momentarily thrown. The request to have Zach speak at the upcoming legislative summit had nearly slipped from his memory. Sliding his phone back into the snug pocket of his suit jacket, he noted with mild surprise how long it had been since the topic of government bans on virtual reality platforms crossed his mind.

A quiet chuckle escaped him as he recalled his past obsession. Back when he wasn’t juggling new job responsibilities, preparing for fatherhood, and overseeing renovations on the house. The irony wasn’t lost on him, life’s demands had a way of shifting priorities. He pulled the phone back out and replied to the text, “You’re in, details to follow.”

Nothing substantial had come of the talk of bans. Just the usual debates on taxation, advertising regulations and data privacy. Marketing had once again triumphed over regulation. People had not only adapted to artificial intelligence but embraced it. Logging into virtual realms had become commonplace. For shopping, gaming, movies, and even those odd online exercise classes like Zoomba.

He mentally filed Zach’s name on the summit’s agenda, it was one of the final slots left. The more challenging spot to fill was the mega-church pastor who had moved his entire ministry into virtual reality. Bud smirked at the thought; if only more legislators knew their way around the tech, the entire summit could be hosted in VR. Next year he thought as he pushed open the door to the coffee shop, the smell of fresh ground beans and cinnamon wafting toward him.

The shop was buzzing with energy, the afternoon crowd filling nearly every table. Bud felt the familiar comfort of being surrounded by people. He thrived on it, and moments like this reminded him of why. As he stepped into the line, he pondered what had made Zach change his mind about participating. Perhaps the board president’s pressure tipped him over the edge, or perhaps Zach viewed it as a strategic advantage for his career advancement.

Out of the corner of his eye, Bud noticed patrons bypassing the line to grab their pre-ordered drinks or tap their selections into self-serve kiosks. He had done that himself on occasion, but today, he wanted to engage in the ritual of ordering face-to-face. It wasn’t a question of trust, his order was too simple for that: a regular hot coffee and sometimes a piece of fruit. But he valued the momentary exchange, however small.

Standing on his toes, he gave his calves a stretch and moved up to place his order.

The hot coffee felt warm and steady in his hand as he maneuvered through the crowded tables. Spotting a lone, smartly dressed woman at a corner table, Bud’s smile broadened. “Commissioner,” he called out. “Fancy seeing you here!”

“Bud Turner,” Constance Henning replied, her smiled radiant as she stood for a brief embrace. Constance wasn’t one to let caution overshadow an old friendship.

“Let’s walk; it’s dreadfully crowded in here,” Constance said, leading Bud out into the street. Bud followed, an unspoken understanding between them. These meetings were rarely by chance. Occasionally, one would call the other to plan a get-together, sometimes just to catch up, but more often to discuss matters of mutual concern. Pretending they’d bumped into each other had become a playful tradition over the years.

[SCENE: CH08_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Street]

“How are things at the Office?” Bud asked as they strolled, the crisp breeze lifting stray strands of Constance’s hair. He knew she thrived in her role as head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, appointed at the start of the current administration. Still, he imagined she sometimes longed for the dynamic challenges of the private sector.

“All stuffed shirts and talking heads, too much paperwork and far too little pay,” she replied, her tone playful but edged with fatigue. “My staff and I are looking forward to your upcoming summit. Any surprises I should be on the lookout for?”

Bud smiled. “No. Just the usual seminars on why the government shouldn’t interfere, tax, or meddle with our industry.”

Constance’s lips curved into a knowing smile as they paused at the crossing signal. “So, nothing new.”

“Exactly,” Bud said, taking a sip of his coffee. “Just a chance to stay at a nice hotel and eat stale muffins for a couple of days.”

They crossed the street, and Bud watched as Constance deposited her empty cup into a sidewalk trash bin. She turned back, a spark of curiosity in her eyes. “And you? Promotion, looking fit, anything else since we last talked?”

Warmth spread through Bud. “Cheryl’s expecting.”

“Oh, Bud, that’s marvelous!” Constance said, her face lighting up. “You and Cheryl are exactly the type of couple this world needs. Your child is bound to be a little genius.”

Bud chuckled. “It’ll be its mother’s child if it is.”

“Ever the humble one,” Constance said, continuing down the block. “Thanks for meeting me, Bud. It’s always good to see you doing well, not that I ever expect otherwise.”

“Likewise,” Bud said.

Their talk drifted to familiar ground. Tech industry policies, government procedures and upcoming hearings. Bud listened intently, nodding as Constance outlined proposed regulations, although a question nibbled at the edges of his mind. This wasn’t usually the kind of thing that prompted a face-to-face meeting.

They turned into a small park, and Constance sat on an old wooden bench shaded by oaks. She motioned for Bud to join her. The slight tension in her posture told him there was more to come.

“There’s a rumor you might be inviting David Charles to speak at the summit,” she said, her voice dropping to a near whisper.

Bud’s pulse quickened. David Charles was the preacher who’d made waves by moving his entire ministry into virtual reality.

Constance leaned in, her eyes flicking around them as if to ward off eavesdroppers. “As a friend, I’d urge you to reconsider. There may be some controversy around his ministry coming out soon, if not before the summit, then shortly after.”

This was why Bud kept old friendships strong and made new ones with care. He nodded, allowing a small smile to play on his lips. “Oooh. I won’t ask for details.”

“Best that you don’t,” Constance said, standing and smoothing her skirt. The light filtering through the leaves cast shifting patterns across her face.

Bud stood too, amusement tinged with gratitude in his voice. “And I won’t ask where you hear your rumors.”

“Good man.” Constance’s smile was back, sharp and knowing. “He probably asked for a stipend anyway.”

Bud gave a short laugh. “He did. I’ll find someone less flamboyant for that session.”

“I’m sure you will,” she said. “There’s no shortage of voices on religion and tech.”

“Spirituality and technology have always had a colorful relationship,” Bud quipped. “Besides the Amish, we seem to get along just fine.”

=== CHAPTER 09 ===

[SCENE: CH09_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Retreat Center]

Finn shrugged, a gesture that tightened the knot in Zach’s chest. Frustration bubbled just beneath his composed exterior. “Well, all five headsets were here last time we did inventory,” he said, his voice edged with tension as he pointed to the drawer, now holding only four headsets.

“It must be around here somewhere,” Finn muttered, adjusting his worn baseball cap while his eyes roved the basement room with quick, darting glances.

Zach watched him and felt the pulse in his temples throb.

After a tense silence, Finn continued, leaning over to peer into a half-empty drawer. “Which one is missing?” Finn continued, leaning over to peer into the half-empty drawer.

“Number five, the last one we made,” Zach replied, trying to keep the urgency out of his voice. He scanned the room again, knowing full well he had already checked every corner. We can’t afford something like this to happen, he thought, jaw tightening. “Sarah was the last one through the protocol, which headset did she use?”

“Three, I think.” Finn said, crossing the room and starting to rummage through a box at the far end. “Maybe it got mixed in with these,” he suggested, his voice muffled as he sifted through the pile of spare parts. Zach narrowed his eyes, watching the haphazard way Finn searched.

“That’s the parts box, Finn,” he said, striding over, trying to control the impatience creeping into his tone.

“Yeah, but some of these parts are full headsets,” Finn shot back, turning one over and squinting at its markings.

Zach reached into the box, lifting another headset, and inspecting it. Each passing second gnawed at his focus as Finn moved to open more drawers and cabinets. This room was supposed to be secure, their designated testing space. Headsets only left to run the protocol in the meditation cells upstairs, no exceptions. They would need gps tags and security cameras.

Finn let out a frustrated huff as he shut a drawer with more force than necessary and signed in to the visitor logging terminal. “Almost no one’s been down here since the last inventory,” he said, showing the screen to Zach, brows furrowed.

Zach looked at the list, his eyes skimming the familiar names but finding no answers. Whoever it was had to know what they were looking for.

“Without the software, there’s nothing anyone could do with it, right?” Finn asked, his voice breaking the silence, though there was an edge of doubt in it.

Zach clenched his jaw, feeling the pressure in his chest intensify. “Well, maybe that’s beside the point,” he said, handing the sheet back to Finn. “Tim updated all of them. Even if someone tried to load the AI without decrypting it, it wouldn’t work.”

“Here it is!” Finn’s sudden exclamation broke the tension, and Zach’s head snapped up, pulse quickening. Carly stepped into the room at that exact moment, her eyes catching Zach’s before darting to Finn.

“Here’s what?” Carly asked, her voice calm but curious as Zach pushed the sign-in sheet back into Finn’s hands and moved quickly to inspect the headset.

Relief flooded him as he recognized the number five etched by the earpiece. The tightness in his chest eased, and he took a slow, steady breath. Crisis averted, this time.

“Zach thought we’d lost one of the headsets,” Finn said, a trace of humor in his voice as he logged out of the visitor terminal and headed for the door. “Should I sign in since I was here helping you look for it?”

Zach managed a wry smile, the tension giving way to a weary amusement. “Very funny, Finn.” He placed the number five headset carefully back into its proper drawer, feeling the weight shift off his shoulders, even if just for a moment. Finn left, his muttering voice fading down the hall, leaving Carly and Zach alone in the quiet room.

He glanced at her, catching a flicker of concern in her eyes. “One wasn’t put back, and I panicked,” he said, the admission coming out as a half-apology.

“Fair enough,” Carly replied, taking a seat at one of the desks. She shifted, crossing her legs, her tone changing to something more serious. “You do know that at some point we’re not going to be able to control when and how these are used.”

Zach’s mouth set in a thin line. The thought had gnawed at him for weeks, a persistent undercurrent to every task. “Indulge me until then, please,” he said, the words feeling heavier than he intended.

“The story got posted this morning,” Carly said after a pause, reaching into her pocket and holding her phone up as if to show him. He glanced at the screen, then looked away, not needing the visual to stir the unease already churning in his stomach.

“How bad is it?” His voice was quieter now, the fight momentarily gone.

“Oddly enough, it isn’t bad at all,” Carly said, turning the phone back toward herself and scrolling. “Modern meditators have had a breakthrough in their quest for enlightenment with the help of virtual reality,” she read aloud.

Zach exhaled a long, weary sigh, rubbing the back of his neck. “Did they use your quote?” The tension trickled back, a small rivulet working its way into his thoughts.

“An abbreviated version,” Carly said, a light laugh slipping through as if to reassured him. “No real information on how it works or what it really does.”

“No hint about the original source?” He lifted his gaze, trying to find a thread of hope in her expression.

Carly shook her head and slipped her phone back into her pocket. “I’m not sure it matters now,” she said, her voice resigned, but her eyes held a guarded alertness.

The article had been posted on The Modern Meditator website, nestled in their technology section. Zach’s considered potential sources then thought better of it. Too many loose ends, he thought, a familiar frustration gnawing at him.

“We need to regroup and talk strategy for publicity,” Zach said, moving toward the door, his steps brisk, fueled by a simmering determination. Just as he reached the threshold, another thought halted him. He turned, locking eyes with Carly. “Should we consider putting everything on hold until we know more?”

Zach noticed her quick calculation, weighing the consequences. The center had been cautious so far, but even patience had its limits.

“I was thinking the opposite,” Carly said at last, and for a moment, the certainty in her voice made him pause.

His brow furrowed, confusion and curiosity mingling. Before he could respond, she pressed on.

“The protocol has been working beyond our wildest dreams. One hundred percent success rate. Everyone’s meditation practice has been elevated because of it,” she said, her conviction building.

Zach’s fingers curled into a fist at his side. Success at what cost? The question burned in him, but he stayed silent. “Yet the arahants keep leaving, going to the hermitage at Jeta’s Grove, disappearing into the wilderness, who knows where.” The term “arahants” had become commonplace, first suggested by Tim as a nod to the Buddhist idea of those who had gained true insight. Zach had resisted the term initially, finding it archaic, but the word had settled into their vocabulary as if it belonged.

He thought of Sherry, the first arahant, who had slipped away one night, leaving behind nothing but questions. She hadn’t been heard from since.

“All living in peace, free from the bondage of suffering, many dedicated to helping others on the path,” Carly countered, her voice softening but unwavering. “That remains the goal, right?”

Zach’s gaze dropped for a moment as he considered her words. The room felt smaller, like it was closing in on him. It is the goal, he reminded himself, but that didn’t make the unknowns any easier to bear.

=== CHAPTER 10 ===

[SCENE: CH10_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's Office]

Bud reached over his desk and grabbed the television remote, turning up the volume. He preferred having the news on mute while he worked, ready to unmute it if anything caught his eye. Today, the top-of-the-hour headlines did just that.

“Virtual reality evangelist David Charles was indicted this morning on several charges, including charity fraud, tax fraud and wire fraud. Charles is accused of redirecting legitimate charitable donations and using his virtual reality ministry to scam followers out of millions of dollars through deceptive or fraudulent credit card and bank transactions. Voxis, the platform Charles used to promote his ministry and conduct these fraudulent activities, has publicly denied any involvement.”

I bet they have, Bud thought as he lowered the volume, tuning out the rest of the broadcast. Another one was downed by greed. The realization of how close he’d come to trouble sent a wave of gratitude toward Constance, unspoken but heartfelt.

Bud pulled a up the file marked “Conference” on his computer and clicked to the sponsorship list. His eyes scanned the page until he confirmed it, Voxis was not on the list. Relief washed over him for the second time. While he doubted they had been complicit, their involvement would have triggered a compliance nightmare if those fraudulent transactions had passed through their payment systems.

He scanned through a few more pages and checked the speaker list. Charles’s name was nowhere to be found, not even penciled in as a possibility. The sharp beep of an alert interrupted him; his news aggregator had picked up the story. He’d programmed it to notify him of any mention of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Leaning closer, Bud clicked on the notification to read the more detailed account.

The article outlined a familiar tale of deceit. The only twist was that this time fraud had been orchestrated in the realm of virtual reality. A grainy image of Charles’s avatar accompanied the piece. Guilty as sin, Bud thought as he finished reading and scrolled through his feed.

Articles on virtual reality classes at a medical college, virtual reality concerts and new headsets designed to deliver scents for a deeper experience flashed by. He skimmed through them, finding nothing noteworthy.

Just as he was about to close the window, a headline caught his attention: “Modern meditators using artificial intelligence and virtual reality in their quest for enlightenment.”

Here was something. Bud clicked on the link. The story, posted that morning, described a group of meditators at a retreat center who had developed a virtual reality program incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance meditation. The article offered no technical details about the program or its code, but something about it resonated with Bud.

He leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing as he considered the potential implications. This wasn’t just another flashy product or thinly veiled money-making scheme. This was different.

“The ultimate goal of mindfulness meditation is the alleviation of suffering,” Bud read aloud from the article, noting the quote attributed to Carly Rice, the director of the retreat center. “Mindfulness is not a religion, it is a science, so why not use the most cutting-edge technology to help us get there?”

He nodded to himself. This was the antithesis of a David Charles scenario, low-profile, genuinely beneficial to users, and not driven by money.

A smile played at the corners of his mouth as he navigated to the retreat center’s website. They offered ten-day introductory meditation courses and longer-term programs for seasoned participants, even a permanent living option at a place called Jeta’s Grove. He scanned the page for a contact number, dialed, and listened as the call connected.

“Hello?” The voice on the other end was female, unpolished, and unexpected.

Bud’s brow furrowed. No automated greeting or formal introduction, odd. “Oh, hello there. I’m looking for your director, Carly Rice,” he said, masking his surprise.

“This is she,” the woman replied smoothly. “How can I help?”

He glanced at the phone, momentarily taken aback before answered. “This may sound strange, but I just read an article about your use of virtual reality in meditation.”

“That was quick; it was published just this morning,” Carly responded, her tone laced with curiosity. “And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?”

Bud cleared his throat. “My name is Bud Turner. I’m on the planning committee for an upcoming legislative summit on virtual reality. I hope this isn’t too forward, but I was wondering if you or someone from your center might be willing to come and give a brief talk about your work.”

“Well, that’s intriguing, Bud,” Carly said. “What exactly would you want us to discuss?”

“The virtual reality aspect, of course,” Bud explained. “And how artificial intelligence has enhanced your practice. Nothing too technical. We’ll have some industry folks, but the audience will mainly be legislators, regulators, and their staff. The summit is called ‘VR and AI in Everyday Life.’ We’re hoping to show decision-makers practical uses of the technology, and to be honest, what you’re doing sounds incredibly compelling.”

“That it is, Bud, that it is,” Carly said, clearing her throat. “I’ll need to run this by my board, of course. One of our board members, Tim Mulvaney, might be a good fit to speak. Could you send me more information, like the dates?”

Bud jotted down her email and assured her he’d forward all the details in case she had questions. Hanging up, he leaned back, a satisfied smile tugging at his lips. What a refreshing conversation, he thought as he opened a new tab to start his due diligence on the retreat center.

A general search brought up social media posts from attendees at the retreat center, all glowing with praise. He dug deeper, checking their charitable status and clicking through their incorporating documents to see what might be hidden beneath the surface.

Bud’s eyes narrowed when he spotted a familiar name on the board of directors. Zach Goodman.

“Well, that explains a lot,” he muttered, leaning back with a thoughtful expression.

[SCENE: CH10_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

At home later that night Bud rubbed his eyes, feeling the strain as he leaned into the worn leather of his chair. Printouts of news articles and regulatory briefings lay scattered across his desk, illuminated by the cold blue light of his computer screen. The room was dark, the shadows stretching like specters around him as he pushed to finish his opening remarks for the conference.

A headline on the screen snagged his attention: “Gaming Giant Shutters Mental Health Division Amid Regulatory Concerns.” Below it, another headline read, “VR Meditation App Raises Privacy Red Flags.” He’d been collecting articles like these for weeks, each one a piece in the narrative he was shaping, a case for balanced oversight over knee-jerk regulation. Public sentiment swayed wildly between tech optimism and fear-driven panic, leaving no stable middle ground.

His phone buzzed, and the name on the screen made him sigh. Frank O’Hearn. Of course, Frank would still be up at this hour.

“Evening, Frank,” Bud answered, forcing energy into his voice.

“How’s the speech coming?” Frank’s tone was sharp, impatient.

“Almost there,” Bud said, flipping through a stack of notes. “I’m trying to strike the right tone. Thinking of starting with some historical context, the days when computers filled entire rooms, the early days of the internet. Show that we’ve faced this before.”

“Good, good,” Frank said after a pause. “But remember why we’re doing this conference, Bud. We need these legislators to see what’s at risk. Every added compliance demand, every new regulation, they’re antithetical to innovation.”

Bud stood and moved to the window, staring out at the glittering city below. “I know, Frank. But we can’t completely ignore their worries. Some of these uses, mental health, altered states of consciousness…”

“That’s exactly the mindset that’ll sink us,” Frank interrupted, his voice cutting like a knife. “The minute we treat every new technology like a threat, we hand the industry to our competitors overseas. Do you think they’re wringing their hands over this in Shanghai?”

“No, but…”

“But nothing. Look, you’re good at this, Bud. You know how to make them feel heard while steering them where we need them to go. That’s why you’re up there and not me.” Frank’s laugh came through the line, brittle and humorless. “I’d just tell them to get the hell out of our way.”

A small smile tugged at Bud’s lips. Frank’s bluntness was oddly reassuring, even if it would be disastrous in the current climate. “Don’t worry. I’ll thread the needle.”

“You better. Word is the Commerce Committee is already drafting new oversight frameworks for neural interfaces. Neural interfaces! Most of that tech is still theoretical, and they’re already looking to regulate it.”

Bud’s eyes narrowed as he leaned over his desk, clicking through the files on his computer screen. “Which is exactly why this conference matters,” he said. “Get them in the room, show them the real applications, the jobs being created, the problems being solved. Make it concrete.”

“Just don’t let them drag the panels down with questions about worst-case scenarios and hypothetical risks. Keep it focused on the now, on what’s working.”

Bud’s gaze fell to his notepad, where he’d scrawled a line during one of his brainstorming sessions: Better to have these technologies developed in the open than in shadows. “Understood. Though I still think we need to acknowledge…”

“Did you see the news about First Life Church?” Frank cut in. “Their whole virtual congregation program is imploding. That’s the kind of PR nightmare we don’t need right now.”

Bud’s expression hardened. “David Charles,” he muttered. The headline and details flashed through his mind. “Didn’t you know him from the country club?”

“Never trusted him. Using VR for religion was asking for trouble.” Frank’s tone sharpened, each word brimming with disapproval. “But mark my words, they’ll use this as ammunition to justify clamping down on the entire industry.”

“All the more reason to get ahead of it,” Bud replied, his fingers drumming lightly on the desk. “Show them we’re responsible actors, that we take legitimate concerns seriously.”

“Just don’t lean too far into the conciliatory tone. We need their focus on opportunity, not fear.” Frank’s sigh crackled through the line, weary but resigned. “I know you’ll get it right, Bud. That’s why we chose you for this. Just… keep the big picture in mind.”

The call ended, leaving Bud staring at the draft of his speech glowing on the monitor. Frank’s words echoed in his mind: opportunity, not fear. He knew the stakes were high, but Frank’s all-or-nothing approach didn’t sit well with him. Technology as potent as this needed guardrails, didn’t it? The key was finding a balance that protected innovation without stifling it.

Bud’s hands hovered over the keyboard before he started typing, each keystroke a deliberate attempt to strike that balance. He needed to craft a message that bridged the chasm between Silicon Valley’s “move fast and break things” mindset and Washington’s penchant for preemptive regulation. There had to be middle ground, a way to…

“You’re still at it?”

The unexpected voice pulled Bud from his thoughts. He looked up to see Cheryl standing in the doorway, holding two cups of coffee. The house had been so quiet that he’d almost forgotten he was working from his home office.

“Lost track of time,” he said, taking one of the cups with a grateful nod. “The conference is day after tomorrow.”

“And you’ll be brilliant, as always.” Cheryl perched on the edge of his desk, eyes skimming over his notes. “Though I’m not sure caffeine at this hour is the best idea. Mine at least is decaf.”

“Says the woman enabling me,” Bud said with a half-smile. He took a sip of the coffee, feeling the tension in his shoulders ease slightly. “Sorry I’m not better company tonight.”

“Please. I knew exactly what I was getting into when I married DC’s favorite tech whisperer.” Cheryl’s smile was warm as she touched his hand. “Just don’t stay up too late. Walking into a room full of politicians running on no sleep is never a good idea.”

“Almost done,” he said, trying to sound reassured. “Just need to fine-tune the opening a bit.”

She leaned over, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Don’t let Frank push you too hard. He forgets sometimes that not everyone shares his… intensity.”

As she left the room, the door clicked shut behind her. He exhaled slowly, his shoulders dropping an inch as the air seemed to expand around him. The space felt different now—quieter, yet somehow more breathable. She was right about Frank, always relentless. But she was also right about him being the right person for this job. Bud knew how to talk to both sides, finding that delicate balance where common ground could be forged, even when it seemed impossible.

He turned back to his screen, eyes scanning the list of conference attendees: politicians, regulators, industry leaders, all converging in one place to shape the future of technology. Most of them had only a surface understanding of its true potential. His gaze caught on a name: Tim Mulvaney, slated to speak on meditation applications. A flicker of recognition stirred in Bud’s mind, Carly Rice’s choice to attend. The dots began to connect. Zach, Frank, neural networks, AI enlightenment. This Tim character might be bringing something significant to the table now that the retreat center was experimenting with that new AI-driven headset.

The warmth of the coffee seeped through him, as his fingers resumed typing. Outside the window, the city lights glimmered like stars scattered across the dark canvas of night. In the stillness of his home office, Bud Turner crafted his speech, words chosen with precision for a future that was hurtling toward them all, faster than most of them realized.

=== CHAPTER 11 ===

[SCENE: CH11_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Conference]

Zach watched Bud step down from the podium, a wave of polite applause following him as legislators and industry leaders leaned in to offer handshakes. Bud’s speech had hit all the familiar beats. References to history’s turning points like electricity and the internet, balanced notes on innovation versus oversight, even that worn anecdote about the man with the red flag leading electric cars, which Zach had heard a dozen times but still drew a smattering of chuckles.

Zach’s eyes caught the reaction of the senators, their nods approving of Bud’s words about driving development underground through excessive regulation. The tension in Zach’s chest tightened. He had seen those looks before. They weren’t just about concern or genuine policy alignment, they hinted at something more calculating, something tied to revenue and control.

As Bud made his way back to his seat, Zach noticed Frank O’Hearn in the front row, giving a slight, approving nod. It seemed to affirm that Bud’s role as the opening act had done exactly what it was supposed to, set the agenda without ruffling feathers. Zach tried to absorb the shift in the room, the subtle current of purpose that pulsed beneath the surface of every handshake and glance.

A disquiet stirred in Zach, a remnant from his last conversation with his co-worker Joe about platform bans and the whispers of scandal surrounding VR churches. It appeared as if they were all perched on the cusp of something greater, a reality no one dared to acknowledge. The technology was evolving at breakneck speed. What if they were already too late to shape it? He pushed down the unease as the first panel began to assemble on stage. It wasn’t his job to fixate on unknowns, not yet at least.

July heat clung to Zach as he wiped a trace of sweat from his forehead and made his way to the podium that afternoon and gave his prepared remarks.

“In conclusion, while minimal and sensible regulation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality can help foster a competitive environment, overreaching or innovation-discouraging regulation will only kill progress in the field.”

The applause was polite but muted, a professional reflex rather than genuine enthusiasm. Zach’s gut tightened with the familiar sting of a lukewarm reception. As he stepped off the stage, his eyes met Bud’s, who was waiting in the wings with a practiced smile.

“Great job, great job,” Bud said, extending a firm handshake before pivoting back to the audience. Zach watched as Bud strode onto the stage to announce a break before dinner, seamlessly transitioning the energy in the room.

Zach doubted Bud’s praise. Maybe passable, he thought, but certainly not great. The hallway felt cooler as he stepped away from the crowd, heading toward the conference room reserved for speakers. The tension in his shoulders eased with every step; at least it was over. His speech had been a product of the legal department’s pen more than his own, tailored precisely to Bud’s expectations. He could have done better if given more freedom. But it was done, and that counted for something.

“Mr. Goodman!”

The voice came from behind him, and he turned to see a young woman weaving through the thinning crowd to catch up.

“Hello,” he said, offering a polite smile as she reached him.

“Hi,” she replied, slightly breathless as she slowed to a stop. “Great talk, you managed to make a very boring subject interesting.”

“Thanks,” Zach said, a wry smile breaking through. “Not sure if I changed any minds, but I tried.” He extended his hand automatically.

“Oh, sorry,” she said, a faint blush coloring her cheeks as she took his hand. “I’m Jessica Everett. I work in policy for the state senate.”

He nodded, a flicker of interest sparking. “So, one of the people I was hoping to reach with that speech?”

“I suppose so. I just started in this position and am already learning a lot,” she said, fumbling in her handbag before pulling out a card and handing it to him.

Zach glanced at the card, Jessica Everett, Policy Analyst, State Senate.

“I wanted to say hello because I love virtual reality,” Jessica said. “It must be fascinating creating content for it. Your bio mentioned you were in programming before becoming a project director?”

“You read the bios?” Zach raised an eyebrow, surprised. Nobody read the bios.

“I read everything. Are you staying for tomorrow’s program? I’d love to grab a coffee and pick your brain on some stuff.”

“Uh, yes, I am,” Zach replied, still adjusting to the sudden turn in the conversation. “I have a friend presenting at one of the morning sessions. I’ll be at lunch; can we talk then?”

“Perfect. Well, I won’t keep you any longer. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Goodman,” she said, turning and walking away.

Zach felt a small smile on his lips. “You can call me Zach,” he called after her, the formality of “Mr. Goodman” making him feel ancient.

She glanced back with a bright smile. “Great, Zach. See you tomorrow.”

[SCENE: CH11_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Conference]

The morning session broke into three smaller groups, and Zach found himself navigating through the hall toward the one where Tim Mulvaney would be speaking. Unlike Zach’s own presentation the day before, this was a more intimate setting. It seemed to have drawn a respectable crowd. He spotted a few familiar faces: senators, commissioners, even a couple of federal officials.

There was a buzz of interest that hinted Tim’s talk would be anything but dull. Zach’s mind drifted back to when Carly had first asked Tim to speak for the retreat center about the protocol. He remembered Tim’s initial surprise, how Carly’s stance on publicity had seemed to shift after that first news story. He had been surprised no other articles had appeared. The fears that once crackled like static around the edges of conversations had died down; people hadn’t grasped what the protocol truly did from the one article. Zach wondered if today’s session might finally bridge that gap.

As the host’s voice rose above the chatter, Zach settled into his seat, notes forgotten as he focused on Tim’s expression. “Please welcome Tim Mulvaney, here to speak about the use of virtual reality in meditation practice.”

There was sparse but expectant clapping as Tim stepped to the podium, shuffling his notes one last time.

Zach leaned forward, a sense of anticipation building. This could be the moment everything started to shift, especially if Tim really explained the full ramifications of the protocol.

“Good morning,” Tim began, folding his notes and placing them neatly on the podium. Zach noticed the slight tremor in Tim’s hands. “I must admit I’m not a practiced public speaker, and I’ve never given a talk to such an esteemed audience.” The crowd responded with a few polite chuckles, easing some of the tension in the room.

Zach leaned back in his chair, a hint of a smile forming. Tim’s delivery was genuine, earnest in a way that set him apart from the more polished speakers.

“What I lack in experience, I more than make up for in enthusiasm,” Tim continued. Zach could see his eyes widening, lighting up his friend’s face. “Hopefully, some of you will share that enthusiasm before my time is up this morning.”

Tim tapped the podium lightly before speaking again. “Let’s start with a question for you: why do people meditate? Anyone, just shout out an answer if you have one.”

“To lower their blood pressure,” someone called out, prompting laughter around the room.

“Yes, yes,” Tim acknowledged with a nod. “Why else?”

“Reduce anxiety,” came another voice, followed by a ripple of answers.

“Increase creativity.”

“To clear the mind.”

“Mindfulness.”

Zach’s eyes darted around as Tim nodded along, his energy building with each response. Then, unexpectedly, Jessica Everett’s voice rang out from the back, drawing Zach’s attention. “To attain enlightenment.”

A flicker of surprise crossed Zach’s face.

Tim pointed at her and clapped, kicking the room’s energy up a notch. “Aha! The original reason to meditate! The attainment of enlightenment. I must admit, the other answers are better for the website and flyers advertising meditation practices. Sitting silently for hours on end with some undefinable and possibly unattainable goal sells fewer seats, for sure.”

Zach’s watched as Tim paused and reached into the podium, pulling out a sleek virtual reality headset. The attendees shifted forward with renewed interest. This was the moment Zach had been waiting for, the intersection of their worlds, and maybe, just maybe, the key to understanding what the protocol truly meant.

“Now this,” Tim said, lifting the headset so everyone could see it, “as you all know, has many uses. Doctors can simulate surgeries, you can box a heavyweight champion fighter, architects can create stunning renderings of buildings, you can practice zoomba with a zebra, board members across the globe can sit next to each other in a virtual boardroom, and of course, you can save the universe with a lightsaber.”

Zach noticed the laughter ripple through the room. He could almost feel the tension lift as the crowd settled into the comfort of humor and relatable examples.

Tim’s voice shifted, drawing Zach’s focus back to the podium. “Now, what if, through the immersion created by artificial intelligence and using this incredible technology, you could accelerate your meditation practice so that, instead of a lifetime, or even many lifetimes, it took only hours, or minutes, to achieve enlightenment?”

A ripple of surprise swept across the room, and Zach watched as eyes widened at the claim. He sensed the change in the room’s atmosphere.

“By enlightenment,” Tim clarified, his voice steady and serious, “I do not mean mindfulness, or anxiety reduction, or lowering your blood pressure, although all that comes with it. I mean full and complete spiritual enlightenment, being completely awake to reality as it is, like the Buddha or numerous religious and spiritual figures have talked about throughout human history.”

Zach’s heart picked up a beat as he scanned the room. No one was glancing down at their phones or shuffling papers. Every eye was locked on Tim. This was more than a tech demo, it was a revelation, and the audience felt it.

Tim continued, “We at the retreat center created a virtual reality program run by artificial intelligence, which we call the Karmic Protocol. It runs on a headset like this one, no magic, no blessed microchips or anointed circuitry. When you put a headset on and run the protocol, you are immersed in a meditative virtual reality space.”

Tim raised the headset to his face for a moment, and Zach felt a twinge of anticipation coil within him..

“The artificial intelligence protocol uses several modern ideas,” Tim said, “such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, binaural tones, and retinal feedback. These tools are used to accelerate and authenticate the insight experience.”

Zach could feel the charged silence in the room. This was no longer a presentation, it was the first step into uncharted territory.Top of Form

Tim set the headset back down, sweeping the room with his gaze. “I was led to believe that while there are some tech experts here, many of you don’t have engineering or computer programming degrees.”

The small chuckle that followed put a bit more ease into the room. “That’s good because neither do I,” Tim added, earning a few light laughs. “Far from it, actually. But I’ll do my best to provide more than just a layperson’s outline of the specifications of the hardware and coding behind the program.”

Tim’s posture shifted, standing a bit taller as he launched into the technical overview. “Think of it like learning to ride a bike. The protocol doesn’t force enlightenment, it shows your brain what that state feels like and helps you maintain it until you can recognize it on your own. The AI adapts to each individual’s neural patterns, finding the quickest path to stable awareness.”

There were subtle nods from the more technical minds in the audience. Even those less versed in programming seemed intrigued. Tim explained the protocol could run on a standard VR headset, but significant upgrades were essential for full functionality. Zach remembered the painstaking process of those enhancements: specialized audio components, electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, and retinal scanners to enable real-time feedback.

Tim gestured as he described the details, moving into the more complex areas of circuitry and processors. Zach was impressed with how effortlessly Tim seemed to weave in technical terms he’d absorbed during the project’s development. It was far from simple talk, but not so dense that the audience would tune out.

“Now, for the programming,” Tim said, his tone shifting with a hint of pride. “The artificial intelligence model relies on machine and deep reinforcement learning, supported by personalized algorithms using affective computing and sentiment analysis of the feedback data we receive.”

The note-taking seemed to intensify, keyboards clacking a little louder.

“Oddly enough,” Tim said, leaning into the podium for emphasis, “we mapped traditional meditation states using EEG patterns and neural oscillation data. That allowed us to develop algorithms that guide users’ brains into those same coherent states. The framework came from Buddhist texts, which provided a blueprint for understanding how consciousness shifts during meditation.”

Zach’s chest tightened with a strange mix of admiration and anticipation. Tim was sharing not just the outcome but the journey. The innovation that came from blending ancient wisdom with cutting-edge technology.

“We had to revisit the very roots of programming language theory to create a unique code that would allow the AI to learn and animate this virtual reality space,” Tim said.

Zach noticed the sudden stillness in the room - people who’d been fidgeting with pens or checking watches now sat frozen, eyes locked on Tim. The usual tech-talk skepticism had vanished from their faces. What Tim was describing wasn’t just another product roadmap; it was like watching someone pull back a curtain on tomorrow. For the first time, Zach could actually picture how the technology they’d been discussing in hypotheticals might reshape what it meant to be human.

“The challenge,” Tim continued, “was that the protocol runs very differently for each individual who uses it. Some report little to no visuals, while others experience distinct shapes or even full scenes. Some hear steady, higher-volume tones and sounds, while others might only get faint chimes.” He paused, and Zach could tell Tim was assessing the room, noticing the blank stares and furrowed brows. Zach shifted in his seat, recognizing the momentary disconnect. Tim needed to pivot.

“We each perceive the external world through a series of lenses that our minds have created over our lifetimes,” Tim said, his voice gaining a conversational tone that Zach knew would reel the audience back in. “The protocol takes each user as they are and removes the scales, layer by layer, from their eyes, so to speak. It acts as a mirror for your thoughts, reflecting your brain’s activity back to you and guiding you with visual and audio cues to help maintain focus and avoid distractions. Using real-time feedback, the protocol helps the brain gradually reach deeper states of meditation.”

Zach saw heads nodding now,. felt a renewed sense of pride for how deftly Tim navigated the room’s shifting energy.

Tim lifted the headset again, its reflective surface catching the overhead lights. “What really enabled this type of application, beyond the innovative AI, was the immersion a traditional platform simply couldn’t provide. The experience of complete audio and visual focus, combined with the sensation of being in an entirely different space from your physical surroundings, allows the protocol to function as a meditation accelerant.”

The audience’s expressions turned thoughtful, and a security guard focused in on the talk for the first time. This was more than technology; it was a leap in understanding human consciousness.

Tim’s tone shifted, a spark of conviction brightening his eyes. “I’m not one who buys into the idea that we live in a time that is more materialistic, hedonistic, or depraved than any other era. But what I do know,” he emphasized, his voice resonating through the room, “is that we live in a time that has explosively evolved in scientific, psychological, and technological advancements. We know more about how the material world works than any generation before us, down to the subatomic level, and that includes knowledge of our own psychology and physiology.”

Tim’s words carried weight, not just as an insight into technology but as a reminder of how far they’d come and where they were heading. The moment felt electric, they were on the brink of something significant.

Tim’s last point resonated. Attendees nodded in silent agreement as Tim continued, waving the headset for emphasis. “At the retreat center, we’ve turned our focus to harnessing all the accumulated progress in these fields to bring peace, understanding, and awakening to the world, one individual at a time.”

Tim raised the headset high, drawing the presentation to a close. “I wanted to thank the organizers of this event for inviting me to share how our retreat center has broken major ground in virtual reality. This isn’t like any other application you’ve heard about here, or maybe anywhere. It’s not designed for sale, with no micro-transactions, no donation requests and no profits have been or will be made. This isn’t about entertainment, information, advertising or social networking. Enlightened beings, the ones I have come to know, find little use for those things. The Karmic Protocol is about elevating and awakening our conscious experience of the world. With the ultimate goal of ending all human suffering.”

Zach saw Bud Turner stand from his seat in the front row, moving to the podium and extending his hand to Tim with a practiced, authoritative ease. “We thank you for coming and sharing this fascinating use of technology,” Bud said, his voice carrying through the room before he turned to the attendees.

“I look forward to seeing you all at the luncheon,” Bud said, stepping away from the podium with Tim by his side.

[SCENE: CH11_S03 | POV: Zach | Location: Conference]

At lunch, Zach made his way to the banquet hall and let the energy of the moment settle in. Conversations around him rose in volume, blending with the shuffling of chairs and the hum of post-presentation discussion. He barely had time to process before Jessica Everett appeared at his table, a smile brightening her face.

“Mind if I join you?” she asked, her eyes meeting his.

“Not at all, not at all,” Zach said, standing and offering a slight bow, a gesture that felt both formal and playful. He pulled out the chair beside him, the anticipation of their earlier conversation making the moment feel significant.

“Everyone, this is Jessica Everett. She works in policy at the state senate,” Zach said as Jessica sat down. “Jessica, this is our Board Chair, Frank O’Hearn,” he continued, motioning at Frank, who gave a casual wave. “Joe Bronski is one of our ace programmers, and Celeste Klein is our vice president of sales.”

The others acknowledged her with nods and smiles as the waiter placed the salad course in front of each of them.

“So, what did you all think of the presentation?” Jessica asked, picking up her fork and idly moving her salad around her plate.

Zach paused, weighing his response. “I thought Tim may have sensationalized aspects of the protocol a bit, but he certainly captured everyone’s attention.”

“I’d say,” Joe interjected with a smile. “It’s all anyone was talking about during the break. One of our freelancers is doing amazing work with quantum algorithms. What’s her name?” he asked, looking at the others, “Sarah something.”

Jessica pressed Zach further. “So, do you not believe the protocol actually enlightens people when they use it?”

Zach felt a flicker of defensiveness rise. “What I believe is of little consequence,” he said with a slight smile. “I always applaud unique applications of modern technology, especially in the health and wellness sector.”

Frank leaned in, eager to join the conversation. “Our company dabbled in that sector once. If I recall, there was a lot of red tape, not to mention the challenge of getting insurers on board to cover it through health plans. It was a meditation app that was aimed at curbing addiction”

Celeste nodded, catching Zach’s eye with a smile. “Yes, except for exercise games, it’s tough to push those applications to market. Even apps meant to be mini-therapists can’t get covered, despite the evidence of success.”

Joe, clearly restless, shifted in his seat. “Speaking of red tape, you did a great job arguing against over-regulation last night, Zach,” he said, steering the conversation back to familiar territory.

“Thanks, Joe,” Zach replied, allowing a grin. “It was a bit dry, but I think I hit on all the points Frank and the legal team wanted me to.” The table erupted in laughter as Frank chuckled and nodded.

“You certainly did,” Frank said. His tone turned more serious as he addressed Jessica. “And I hope you and the senators you work for remember those points when you’re in the back room making decisions on how our industry will be regulated. We’ve managed to strike a good balance that allows real innovation.”

“Like the Karmic Protocol,” Jessica noted, her eyes searching Zach’s.

“We’ll definitely be watching with interest as that project develops,” Celeste added. “Donations and goodwill might have gotten them this far, but bringing something like that into the mainstream will need significant capital.”

Joe leaned back in his chair, a wry smile playing on his lips. “Well, if it really enlightens people like they say, I hope the mainstream isn’t too quick to embrace it. How would we sell more VR headsets if everyone’s sitting around staring at their navels all day?”

The table erupted in laughter. The conversation drifted into lighter topics. Zach, though outwardly engaged, couldn’t help but feel what they’d discussed tugging at him, a reminder that the intersection of technology and human experience was far from simple.

 [SCENE: CH11_S04 | POV: Ed | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Far from the convention center halls, Ed kneeled in the garden at Jeta’s Grove, his hands sinking into the soil. The earth was cool and soft, carrying the faint scent of roots and decay. The rhythm of his trowel was slow but deliberate as he worked through the weeds, careful not to disturb the tender shoots pushing up toward the morning light. His back ached, but the sensation felt distant, like an echo.

Skillful means, he thought, pausing to study a beetle navigating the labyrinth of stems and leaves. The phrase had come to him often since the protocol, less like a mantra and more like the shape of his days. Every action felt precise now, not because of effort but because there was no resistance, just movement, the simplest path forward.

There was no longer the need to get it right. That was the greatest surprise. Before, he had always carried a weight: the pressure to measure each decision, to anticipate every outcome. But now, certainty had become irrelevant. The choices he made, whether in the garden or at the table, were neither perfect nor flawed—they were simply the next steps in a larger pattern he could glimpse but never grasp.

A vine curled around his wrist, its tendrils startling in their delicacy. He traced the pattern with his thumb, marveling at the quiet intelligence of its design. The vine didn’t strategize or weigh its options; it reached for the sun, bending and twisting until it found what it needed. Skillful means, Ed thought again, as he gently guided the vine toward a lattice.

He stood, brushing the dirt from his hands, his gaze drifting to the horizon. Somewhere beyond the hills, there were meetings and debates, people angling for position or pressing for certainty. He had been one of them once, locked in the same cycles of ambition and hesitation. He could still hear their questions, their doubts, even now, though they no longer troubled him.

A sparrow landed on the edge of the garden bed, its small body taut with energy. Ed watched it tilt its head, its dark eyes scanning the soil before darting down to claim an insect. It flew off without hesitation, its movements seamless and unburdened. That was the lesson, he thought—not inaction but flow. To move with the world, not against it.

He kneeled again, his hands returning to the soil. The weeds would come back, and the vines would need more tending. There was no end to the work, but there was also no rush. He smiled faintly as he pulled the next weed, feeling the warmth of the sun on his back.

The garden thrived not because of perfection but because of care, because each act—no matter how small—was enough. He was a fully enlightened being.

=== CHAPTER 12 ===

[SCENE: CH12_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's Office]

Bud found Frank O’Hearn waiting in his office when he returned from lunch. The sight made his pulse quicken; Frank’s presence was rarely a precursor to good news. The Chairman stood at the window, hands clasped behind his back, staring out at the city skyline with an expression Bud couldn’t quite read from behind.

“Quite a view,” Frank said, not bothering to turn. His voice dropped half an octave, each word coming slower than the last. Bud watched his shoulders tense, saw his fingers tightening into fists as the silence between sentences stretched uncomfortably long.

“If only that were true,” Bud finally muttered as he lowered himself into his chair, the leather creaking under him. He forced a calm he didn’t feel, knowing this conversation had been inevitable ever since Tim Mulvaney’s presentation. “I take it you’ve read the transcript?” he asked, keeping his tone even.

Frank turned, the light from outside casting deep lines across his usually stoic face. Bud’s stomach tightened as he caught the rare flicker of concern in the man’s eyes. “Multiple times. This isn’t just another wellness app or meditation guide. From what I can read between the lines of that transcript, they’re talking about fundamentally rewiring human consciousness.”

Bud swallowed, the taste of black coffee and apprehension bitter on his tongue. “And they’ve apparently succeeded,” he said, leaning forward. He thought back to lunch, how Zach’s eyes had darted nervously whenever that Senate staffer pressed him about the protocol? “Did you see how Zach couldn’t quite meet anyone’s eyes during lunch?”

“Like Everett,” Frank said, his expression hardening as he moved to sit across from Bud. The way Frank’s mouth pressed into a thin line told Bud he’d been thinking about her too. “Sharp one, that girl. Too sharp.” He let the rest trail off, the silence doing more to rattle Bud than words could.

“She’s works for the senate, I’d hope she is,” Bud agreed, the thought coiling tighter in his chest. But there was something else gnawing at him, something he saw reflected in the shadow that crossed Frank’s face. “But that’s not what’s really keeping you up at night, is it?”

Frank leaned forward, elbows digging into his knees, the fabric of his suit straining as if burdened by the weight of what he was about to said. “What concerns me, Bud, is what happens when this thing hits wide circulation.” His voice dropped, but the intensity in his gaze did not. “You saw the numbers in Mulvaney’s report, they’re claiming a hundred percent success rate. A hundred percent. Do you have any idea what that could do to the pillars holding up society?”

Bud’s chest tightened. He’d spent nights haunted by that very thought, imagining the unraveling of economies, the collapse of purpose in millions of lives. He nodded slowly, the motion deliberate. “I’ve given it some thought,” he said, choosing his words with care. The understatement tasted like a lie. “The economic implications alone…”

“Exactly.” Frank’s fist thudded against the armrest, the sound sharp, final. Bud felt the reverberation in his core. “A mass exodus from the workforce. Who’s going to give a damn about quarterly profits or market share when they’ve achieved…” Frank’s voice faltered, and he waved a hand as if dismissing a notion too absurd to name, “…whatever enlightenment this thing offers?”

Bud nodded slowly, the weight of the implications pressing down on him like a physical burden. “And that’s assuming the best-case scenario, that it actually does what they claim. If it doesn’t…”

“Then we’re looking at a public health crisis unlike anything we’ve seen before, rewiring people’s brains, this goes beyond wireless signals causing brain cancer.” Frank finished, his voice sharp as a blade. The urgency in the room crackled between them. “Either way, this needs to be contained. Now.”

Bud took a steadying breath, choosing his words with care. “The industry can’t handle this alone. We’d need coordination across multiple agencies, FDA, FCC, Homeland Security…”

Frank’s eyes sparked with recognition. Bud could see the gears turning behind that calculating gaze. “You still have that contact at the Office of Science and Technology Policy?”

“Constance Henning,” Bud confirmed. The mention of her name stirred a memory of late-night phone calls dissecting policies that teetered on the edge of technological overreach. “She’d understand the implications.” He hesitated, ensuring he had Frank’s full attention. The room seemed to tighten around them. “But Frank… once we bring in the government, we lose control of the narrative. This becomes bigger than any of us.”

Frank’s expression didn’t waver. If anything, the edges of his mouth twitched into a hard line. “Sometimes that’s exactly what you need,” he said, pushing himself up from the chair. “Set up a meeting. Quietly. We need to get ahead of this before Mulvaney and his friends start handing these headsets out on the street corners.”

Bud’s heart thudded in his chest, but he forced himself to keep his voice steady. “And Goodman? He’s still technically one of ours.”

Frank’s face hardened, the air between them growing colder. “Not for long. I think it’s time we did some house cleaning of our own.” He strode toward the door but paused, hand on the knob. “Good work at the conference, by the way. Getting Mulvaney to speak may have been the best intelligence we could have hoped for.”

[SCENE: CH12_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's Office]

Bud watched Frank leave, the door clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the room. He sat back, eyes drifting to the darkened computer screen that reflected his own tired face. The silence buzzed around him. He’d built his career at the fragile intersection of technology and policy. But this felt different. Like staring into an abyss where the path forward blurred into darkness.

He pulled up Constance’s contact information, fingers hesitating over the keyboard before he began drafting an email. The keystrokes sounded too loud in the otherwise empty room. Whatever came next, Bud knew they were about to cross a line that couldn’t be uncrossed.

Before sending the email, Bud’s gaze shifted to the folder containing the speakers’ presentation transcripts and videos. The urge to procrastinate warred with the need for clarity. He clicked it open.

Hearing the simplicity of Mulvaney’s language again drew him up short. No bluster, no feverish proclamations about market share. Only plain, earnest words that spoke of using technology to help people find peace in an ever-chaotic world.

“The retreat center has never charged for its services. “Each word resonated with quiet conviction. “This technology, like meditation itself, should be freely available to anyone seeking clarity and understanding.”

Bud’s brow furrowed. Frank’s certainty about hidden agendas and market machinations echoed in his mind, but faced with this speech , so plain, so devoid of the usual self-serving ambition, Bud felt the first crack of doubt. He’d nodded along with Frank’s theories, agreed as O’Hearn outlined conspiracies of social engineering. But now, a quiet dissonance stirred within him.

He closed the file, the screen’s glow a cold reminder of his task. Returning to the email, he pressed on, though the weight of the words felt different now, laden with hesitation he couldn’t afford to show. Good intentions, he reminded himself, didn’t guarantee good outcomes. Still, as he typed, he found himself choosing his words with more care than usual.

=== CHAPTER 13 ===

[SCENE: CH13_S01 | POV: Carly | Location: Retreat Center]

Carly watched as more newcomers pushed past the volunteer at the door of the retreat, their voices cutting sharply through the gentle hum of dinner conversation.

“You can’t keep this to yourselves!”

Carly shifted forward in her chair, a prickle of unease running down her spine, but Sherry’s hand rested lightly on her arm, halting her. “Let Ed handle it,” Sherry said, her voice soft but firm.

Ed was already striding towards the entrance. Carly observed how his calm, commanding presence seemed to soothe the tension instantly. Her gaze flicked to the expressions of those around her. The newest arahants watched with serene detachment, their faces untouched by the brewing conflict. In contrast, the long-term residents betrayed subtle signs of unease, tightened jaws, darting glances. The chasm between the awakened and the unawakened had never felt so stark to Carly.

“The truth,” Ed’s voice rang out, silencing the room with its steady resonance, “is not a possession to be grasped, but a reality to be lived. Please, join us for dinner. We can talk about why you’re really here.”

Carly’s shoulders loosened as the tension in the room dissipated, the seekers moving hesitantly to the seats offered to them. Yet, a gnawing certainty twisted in her chest. This was only the beginning. “We can’t keep operating like this,” she murmured, leaning closer to Sherry. “Either we find a way to scale up safely, or…”

“Or the dharma will find its own way,” Sherry interjected, her voice carrying the same serene confidence that always left Carly with an uncomfortable mix of comfort and disquiet. “Perhaps that’s exactly what’s meant to happen.”

[SCENE: CH13_S02 | POV: Carly | Location: Jetta's Grove]

Later that night, after heading to the quietude of Jeta’s Grove which was settling into the stillness of sleep, Carly wandered the grounds with Sherry by her side. The moon cast a soft glow, throwing elongated shadows across the meditation garden.

“Do you ever regret being the first?” Carly’s question emerged quietly, almost lost in the night air.

Sherry’s silence stretched between them, thoughtful and heavy. “Regret requires attachment to a different outcome,” she said at last, her voice contemplative. “But I understand what you’re asking. No one knew what would happen when I put on that headset. Not even me.”

Carly’s gaze dropped to the gravel path. “And now everyone wants to know. They find in you a great teacher. And they want to experience it for themselves.”

“Not everyone,” Sherry corrected gently. “Just those who are ready to hear their own suffering clearly enough to want to end that suffering.”

Carly’s eyes scanned the shadowed outline of the center, the silent buildings that held so many unanswered questions. “But how do we protect them? Protect this?” She lifted her hand, the gesture encompassing the surrounding center.

“Perhaps protection isn’t what’s needed,” Sherry’s response came, soft but resolute. “Perhaps what’s needed is trust. Trust in the dharma to find its way. Trust in people to find their path.”

“Even if that path leads through here? Through us?” Carly’s voice wavered, the question pressing with the weight of everything that lay ahead.

“Especially then.” Sherry’s smile broke across her face, that radiant, unwavering smile that always reminded Carly of why they had embarked on this experiment to begin with. It anchored Carly, pulling her back to the core of their mission. “We’re not guardians of the gate, Carly. We’re just the ones who happened to find it first.”

Silence settled between them as they walked, punctuated by the rhythmic rise and fall of the cricket song. Carly’s ears caught the faint sound of a door opening and closing somewhere within the main building. She wondered who it might be, a late arrival seeking solace or a resident slipping into the quiet of midnight meditation.

“Whatever comes next,” Sherry said as they rounded the path back toward the residences, her voice softer now, “we’ve done what we set out to do. We’ve shown that it’s possible. The rest isn’t up to us.”

Carly nodded, though the knot in her chest didn’t fully loosen. The thought of tomorrow crept in, the inevitable influx of seekers, the relentless questions, the unyielding pressure to make the protocol more widely accessible. And beyond the boundaries of Jeta’s Grove, she imagined the analysts and powerbrokers contemplating what this all meant, forming their strategies, deciding their moves.

The weight of it, the responsibility, the potential ripple of consequences, the looming unknown, settled heavily over her. Yet beneath that oppressive feeling, a flicker remained. It was small, but undeniable, a reminder of why she had come to this place, why she had supported the project from the outset.

Hope. Not a hope tied to any outcome she could name, but a simple, profound belief: paths to awakening still existed in this world. And they would continue to, even if they emerged in ways no one anticipated.

The moon hung higher now, its pale light catching the windows of the meditation hall. Tomorrow would come as it would. For tonight, the center held its peace, sheltering both the contentment of the awakened and the restless dreams of those still searching for their way.

[SCENE: CH13_S03 | POV: Arahant | Location: Jetta's Grove]

A bit further into the grove, one of the newly awakened sat quietly beneath a tree as the pair passed.

He watched their forms disappear into the darkness, the rhythm of their footsteps absorbed by the night. The surrounding stillness was vast, not an absence but a fullness, as if the air itself was alive with meaning. He could feel the tension clinging faintly to Carly’s movements, her worry a shadow that lingered even in her retreat. Sherry’s calm was steady, a light that didn’t waver, but it wasn’t hers alone. It belonged to the grove, the trees, the stars and the deep silence that bound it all together.

He lowered his gaze to the earth beneath him, the rough bark of the tree pressing gently against his back. The cool grass between his fingers felt impossibly intricate, each blade distinct yet inseparable from the whole. This was the gift of the protocol, not revelation, but the dissolving of boundaries. The world no longer appeared in fragments. It was complete, unified, present.

And yet, he could still feel the ripple of unease from those who had come to the grove earlier that day. Their laughter, their questions, their searching, all of it lingered in the fabric of the place. It wasn’t a distraction. It was simply another thread in the endless pattern, no more or less important than the stars overhead or the insects humming softly in the distance.

He thought of the man who had sat across from him at dinner, his hands fidgeting restlessly with the edge of his napkin. “How do you know?” the man had asked, his voice low, as though the question itself was a risk. “How do you know when it’s real?”

At the time, he hadn’t answered, not because he didn’t want to, but because there was no answer to give. How could he explain that the search itself was the barrier? That what they sought was already within them, waiting in the stillness they feared to face?

Now, in the quiet of the grove, the memory of the question didn’t stir frustration or pity, only understanding. He could see the man’s struggle as clearly as his own reflection on the surface of a pond, distorted but unmistakably real. The anxiety they carried wasn’t separate from his calm; it was part of the same current, flowing toward the same vast ocean.

He exhaled softly, his breath merging with the cool night air. Enlightenment wasn’t an escape. It wasn’t an answer. It was this: the steady pulse of the world, unbroken and complete. It was the recognition that nothing needed fixing, that even the sharp edges of longing and fear were part of the wholeness.

Above him, the canopy shifted gently, the leaves murmuring in the wind. He leaned back against the tree, his body and the earth beneath him indistinguishable for a moment. Tomorrow would come, as it always did. For now, there was only this boundless and infinite space, as it had always been.

=== CHAPTER 14 ===

[SCENE: CH14_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Warehouse]

Tim and Georgia walked the perimeter of the empty warehouse, their heels clicking against the concrete. The vast space seemed to hold its breath, waiting, as if it sensed the significance of what was about to happen. They had chosen this location carefully. It was remote enough for privacy but equipped with the robust power infrastructure needed for the AI components.

The loading dock caught his eye; it would serve their purposes well. But he knew it was the pond out back that had sealed the deal for Georgia. She stood at the dock doors now, her gaze fixed on the late afternoon light playing across the water’s surface.

Tim noted her expression change as she mentioned her grandfather’s fishing pond and the lessons she’d learned there about patience and strategy. “Watch long enough,” he remembered her quoting, “and you’ll see where the fish are going, not just where they are.” The principle had guided their entire search for this place.

Tim’s mind shifted from memories to logistics. He and Georgia had analyzed power grid patterns, local development plans and traffic flows. They had ensured this property stayed off competitors’ radars through a web of shell companies and subtle inquiries. Georgia’s voice echoed in his mind: in corporate acquisitions, the art was making your target look worthless.

He reached into his pocket and wrapped his fingers around his brother’s prayer beads, feeling their familiar weight. To Tim, this warehouse wasn’t just a facility; it was a sanctuary. It would need to safeguard far more than intellectual property.

They walked to the entrance, Tim’s thoughts already mapping out security protocols. Georgia had paid a premium for the place, maneuvering through a maze of indirect transactions—the kind of financial choreography she excelled at. Her grandfather’s lesson on hidden value lingered in Tim’s mind as he glanced at her, knowing she had applied it here too.

[SCENE: CH14_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Warehouse]

Tim turned toward the driveway, noting the fenced perimeter and guardhouse where Finn stood watch. He spotted Jessica driving up in her car as Finn called out, “Everything’s locked up, and I don’t have the keys.”

Tim chuckled, jogging over and pulling out a keychain. “Good on both points,” he replied, unlocking the gate as Finn moved aside.

“What’s good, Jessica?” Finn asked, patting her shoulder as she leaned out the window.

She gave a wry smile. “Not sure if it’s a blessing or a curse, but we definitely live in interesting times.”

Tim stepped back, locking the gate after Jessica drove through. “One can never be too careful,” he said, meeting Finn’s gaze. “Safety is a good habit to get into.”

Tim watched as Jessica parked and surveyed the building. Georgia had done her part. Finding this location hadn’t been easy, not with the electrical demands of their AI project. Now it was up to Tim and the team to map out the layout, identifying what tools, machines and staff they’d need for production.

Georgia was already distracted, her eyes glued to her phone. She glanced up briefly, tension flickering across her usually composed features. “I’ll leave you boys to it. There’s been some concerning stock movement at one of my larger companies - someone’s been quietly accumulating shares through multiple accounts.” She paused, thumb scrolling rapidly. “Never a dull moment in corporate games,” she said, heading to her car. Tim watched her go, noting how her shoulders had tightened at whatever she’d seen on the screen. He’d rarely seen anything rattle Georgia’s calm demeanor.

As she drove off, Jessica turned to Tim. “I worked at a tool shop in college. Never thought I’d come full circle back to manufacturing,” she said, trailing Tim to the entrance.

Tim smirked, recognizing the irony.

Finn chimed in as they stepped inside, “There are many paths to enlightenment. Now, let’s see what we’re working with.”

Tim surveyed the interior. Offices flanked the main hallway, leading to a wide-open manufacturing room in the back. More space than they’d need initially, but that suited him just fine.

They moved through the building, noting down measurements and potential workstation layouts. The covert nature of their project infused the task with adrenaline-fueled excitement that Tim relished.

“The microchips need to be custom made here,” Tim said, running a mental checklist as they concluded their tour. If only Sarah had joined the dharmapalas instead of going through the protocol. She could have come in handy. He wondered what she was up to, if she even thought of microchips or codes anymore. He smiled, knowing she was awake, shook it off and got back to the business at hand.

=== CHAPTER 15 ===

[SCENE: CH15_S01 | POV: Sherry | Location: Soup Kitchen]

Sherry Carpenter had been the first person to go through the karmic protocol. Upon removing the virtual reality headset, she had not laughed, but simply smiled. The tinge of nervousness she had experienced just prior to starting the protocol had vanished, and for lack of a better word she felt content.

She didn’t feel like a Buddha, nor had celestial beings appeared to her. Memories of past lives did not surge back, and nothing supernatural unfolded before her. Yet, she became acutely aware of her presence in space and time, an awareness that filled her with a profound and unshakable contentment.

Within the familiar surroundings of Jeta’s Grove, Sherry continued additional tests related to the protocol. She reported on her progress, meditations and insights as requested. It wasn’t an obligation, it was an experience. The meditators there welcomed her presence. They sat with her, shared meals, and spoke candidly about the challenges they faced in their own practices. They never sought her guidance, and she found herself speaking less, preferring the role of a listener.

Time with the other awakened ones brought Sherry a quiet joy. Their calm energy refreshed her, filling her days with moments that needed no embellishment. They would often retreat to rooms or wander into the surrounding woods, settling into meditation without words. Simply existing in the shared experience of the present. As more individuals went through the protocol, Sherry noticed subtle differences in their enlightenments, some felt compelled to teach, while others, like herself, sought silence and solitude.

The day came when she felt ready to leave the retreat center. There was no announcement or farewell; she simply set off on a long walk one afternoon and did not return. Days blurred into each other as she moved through wooded paths and occasionally passed through small towns. Each place, whether vaguely familiar or completely new, unfolded in vibrant detail, as if seen for the first time through her heightened senses. The crisp crunch of leaves beneath her feet, the sharp, clear calls of birds that had always been present but previously ignored, now, she noticed them all.

When hunger came, it felt instinctive to know which roots, flowers, seeds and berries could nourish her. Sleep became an infrequent visitor, but when she did rest, it was light, a state where awareness lingered, and dreams did not intrude.

In her old life, Sherry had never been particularly charismatic. Those who knew her liked her well enough, but she had always been reserved. Now, however, she noticed how people were inexplicably drawn to her. When she entered a town center and settled on a park bench, it wasn’t long before passersby took note, some even stopping to greet her. She welcomed their attention, though her responses remained brief and direct, with most of the exchange conveyed without words. A glance, a smile, a wave or a nod often said more than her voice could.

As days turned into weeks, she found herself revisiting familiar areas, becoming a familiar face at soup kitchens along her route. She accepted the simple meals they offered and always made a point to arrive early, staying behind to help with tasks that others might rush through. Washing dishes, clearing tables, and sweeping the floor had become meditative practices, tasks she would never have seen in such a light before.

If someone offered her a place to sleep for the night, she would accept, but she never sought it out. Her quiet presence brought a sense of calm, something the staff and patrons valued, even if they couldn’t fully explain why. It was a small comfort to them, the company of someone who was at once vibrant, thoughtful, and silent.

Sometimes, she found herself among the homeless, nestled in encampments under bridges or alongside highways. She walked and meditated with those who had been pushed there by circumstance or choice, always sensing a subtle peace in her presence. Danger never seemed to touch her; she had nothing that could inspire jealousy or theft. When tensions arose, she would step in, her smile dissolving anger, her few words or simple gestures defusing even the most volatile outbursts. She felt a deep connection to those still entangled in their suffering, and without imposing or asserting herself, she did what she could to ease their burdens.

Living this way brought a kind of anonymity that suited her. She wasn’t the center of any gathering or the focal point of any place. Some people knew her as Sherry, but she rarely gave or asked for names. She preferred to be with others in that simple, label-free space. Her ability to understand people, to see into their hearts and minds, was uncanny, but her thoughtful brevity kept the interactions from feeling unsettling.

Sherry’s suffering had dissolved through understanding, mental discipline and insight. She followed the middle path with ease, aiding others on their journeys, whether they realized they were on one or not. For months, she lived a life that was serene and full, surrounded by nature and those society often overlooked. She had no phone, no email, no social media, no mailing address. No debts, credit cards, bank accounts, streaming subscriptions, or loyalty cards. This absence of ties made it much harder for those searching for her to track her down.

“Sherry Carpenter?” The voice broke the quiet rhythm of her cleaning as she wiped down the folding tables in the church basement after the lunch service. The sound of her full name startled her; it had been so long since she’d heard it.

“Yes,” she answered, setting the cloth down gently.

“I’m Agent Fiona Gile,” a woman in a suit continued, another suited gentleman behind her. “We’re with Homeland Security, and we were hoping to ask you some questions.”

[SCENE: CH15_S02 | POV: Sherry | Location: Homeland Security Office]

After a brief drive, Sherry sat quietly in the corner of the Homeland Security office, the room’s sterile light casting cold reflections on the desks and filing cabinets. She had expected the questioning to be tense for the agents, but instead, Agent Fiona Gile had been surprisingly affable, her voice steady and probing but never harsh. Her partner hadn’t masked his frustration as well. However, each question Fiona posed carried a hidden edge, as though she was carving through Sherry’s responses for a hidden truth.

The questioning had ended, but Sherry remained, waiting to be dismissed, or given further instructions. Across the room, she could hear the agents talking. One typed on his computer, the rhythmic tapping somehow comforting in the silence. Fiona scrolled through her phone, muttering to herself.

“How does someone agree to be a guinea pig for an untested, radical, mind-bending thing like this without knowing how it works?” Fiona’s voice cut through the room, loaded with incredulity.

Sherry’s gaze dropped to the floor, taking in the scuff marks on her shoes as the partner’s response came with a half-hearted chuckle. “Never experimented with LSD?” The room’s atmosphere stiffened as Fiona didn’t laugh. The agent cleared his throat. “She was clear there was no coercion.”

The phone rang, and Fiona’s hand shot out to grab it. “Agent Fiona Gile,” she said, the professionalism in her voice unwavering. Sherry glanced up, watching Fiona’s brow furrow as she listened. From the tone, Sherry guessed it was someone senior, likely the boss.

“No, sir, we completed our interview. We are about to release her,” Fiona said, her voice carefully neutral. A pause, followed by a slight tightening of her jaw. “She was cooperative. We have names, dates, everything she could give us.”

Sherry caught the subtle shift in the partner’s posture; he leaned back in his chair, arms folded, his eyes flicking toward her. He seemed thoughtful, as though reviewing their conversation in his mind.

“She isn’t going anywhere, sir,” Fiona continued, glancing at Sherry for a brief moment. “She appears to volunteer at the same soup kitchen regularly. If we need to follow up…”

A harsh voice crackled through the receiver, too low for Sherry to catch the words, but the tone spoke volumes. Fiona’s shoulders tensed, and she looked over at her partner with a slight frown.

“Yes, sir,” Fiona said finally, her voice clipped. “Understood.”

The room seemed to breathe out as Fiona hung up. For a moment, silence stretched thin. Sherry could feel the undercurrent of tension settling between the agents.

Fiona turned to the other agent, a resigned look in her eyes. “The boss wants us to keep her,” she said, her voice low. “With or without her consent.”

The agent’s brow furrowed as he shifted in his chair, glancing at Sherry with a look she felt almost bordered on an apology. “Oh, I’m sure she’ll stay willingly,” he said, but there was an unspoken question in his tone: But why? The discomfort on his face mirrored the strange unease settling in Sherry’s chest.

“We’ll get the briefing tonight,” Fiona said, raising her hands in a gesture of frustration before turning back to her notes. Her partner did what he always did, turned his attention to other things.

“Well will you look at this?” Sherry heard the agent remark after a brief silence. “Advent Industries announces major market move with strategic investment initiative.”

“Isn’t that O’Hearn’s company?” Fiona replied, betraying surprise. Sherry paid closer attention.

“That wasn’t lost on me.” Her partner quipped, tossing the newspaper over the desk to Fiona. “First an all-points bulletin to find the Sato facility, now O’Hearn is positioning himself for something bigger.”

“Looks like Georgia Sato is getting hit from all sides.” Fiona said, looking over the article herself. “Coordinated pressure. Ever feel like a corporate pawn partner?”

Sherry sat still, absorbing every detail.

=== CHAPTER 16 ===

[SCENE: CH16_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Virtual Boardroom]

Bud Turner scanned the virtual boardroom, noting the last couple of avatars materializing into their seats at the table. Each avatar was an impressively accurate replica of the real person, with a name and position displayed in bright lettering above. His gaze drifted to the large screen at the end of the table, a tool that any participant could use to present information to the group.

The room’s design was meant to simulate a typical boardroom: a polished hardwood table at its center, plants lined neatly along one wall, and a long window with its shade drawn down on the opposite side. Bud’s attention caught on the virtual door in one corner, designed to mimic real-life interruptions with a knock if someone tried to join after the meeting began.

In front of him, a virtual notepad sat waiting, paired with a pen ready for scribbling. He flexed his fingers, knowing he could pull up a private computer screen with a gesture if needed. The room’s features were meticulously crafted, participants could mute their voices or movements, and a dark shroud would descend over their avatars should they need to temporarily exit the virtual setting. Bud appreciated the thoroughness of the design; it mirrored the real-life subtleties of human interaction while adding a layer of control.

The attendees were a testament to Bud’s influence and the tech industry’s reach. He recognized Constance Henning, his friend, and a trusted ally, already seated. Nearby, Lawrence Cray, Under Secretary of Science and Technology from Homeland Security, leaned forward, tapping a finger on his virtual notepad. Next to Cray sat Gwen Trout, the no-nonsense Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA. The Senior Counsel for Privacy and Security Enforcement at the FTC was present too, their avatar projecting the sharp intensity Bud had come to expect. Each high-ranking official was accompanied by a senior staff member.

Bud’s eyes shifted to Frank O’Hearn, the only other industry representative in the room. Frank had pushed relentlessly for this gathering, insisting Bud and Constance organize it. Constance’s attendance at the virtual reality conference, where the karmic protocol had first been demonstrated, had made the persuasion easy. Bud knew she had immediately grasped the potential, and the risks, of the protocol’s broader implementation. Now, their task was to convey this urgency to the rest of the group and guide them toward crafting a proactive response plan.

“Thank you all for logging in and thank you to Bud Turner for allowing us to use the Virtual BoardRoom for this meeting,” Constance began, her tone authoritative but appreciative. Bud felt a faint wave of pride at her acknowledgment. “I assume you all received the briefing file I circulated, which included the video and transcript of Tim Mulvaney’s presentation at the recent Virtual Reality Conference about the so-called karmic protocol.”

Bud’s eyes flicked around the room, observing the subtle nods from the other avatars as they confirmed receipt of the materials. Constance continued without missing a beat. “Under Secretary Cray was the first person I contacted regarding this, and our preliminary investigations suggest that Mr. Mulvaney’s claims about the protocol are accurate.”

Cray leaned forward slightly, his avatar’s movements stiff and mechanical. “Indeed,” he said, his voice steady. “We’ve confirmed Mulvaney’s assertion that the retreat center, known as Jeta’s Grove in upstate Vermont, has functioning prototypes, and preliminary reports indicate that dozens, possibly more, individuals have already undergone the protocol.” Bud noted the slight strain in Cray’s voice, a signal of the weight of what Homeland Security had uncovered. He knew Cray’s team had been compiling detailed narratives and dossiers, framing the participants as ‘victims,’ a term that hung heavily in the room, highlighting the stakes at hand.

“Let me formally introduce Bud Turner and Frank O’Hearn from the industry,” Constance said, gesturing toward their avatars. Bud resisted the urge to shift uncomfortably. The spotlight always brought an anticipatory tension. “They have been instrumental in helping us understand the scale and implications of this issue.”

“Thanks, Commissioner,” Frank interjected, his tone crisp and direct. “Bud and I have been reviewing Mulvaney’s claims with our engineering and programming teams. We’ve reached a few conclusions that we believe warrant immediate attention from the administration.” Bud’s ears perked up at Frank’s choice of words. “Actionable intelligence,” Frank continued, and Bud mentally repeated the phrase, feeling the subtle irony of it. Frank’s voice was smooth, but Bud knew his colleague’s disdain for bureaucracy all too well.

Director Trout’s avatar shifted as she spoke. “We conducted a comprehensive search through our records, and there is no application on file for a device or outcome of this nature,” she stated, her tone clipped and matter of fact. Bud saw a brief, almost imperceptible frown cross her face before she continued. “Given the information we have, it’s clear that such a device should have followed our medical device licensing tracks before human trials began.”

Frank nodded slightly, continued, “Second, we need to address the use of the retinal scan, electroencephalogram and biofeedback components. These pose significant mental health risks, like identity distress and surveillance anxiety, not to mention critical data privacy concerns.”

Bud’s gaze settled on the FTC attorney as they spoke. “We, too, have checked,” they said, their voice cool and deliberate. “Although we can’t be sure they are collecting any data, if they are there’s no record of collection or usage of this nature filed with the FTC.” Bud felt the room’s tension ripple, a palpable undercurrent that solidified the gravity of their conversation. He clenched his jaw, recognizing that this was just the beginning of what would undoubtedly be a drawn-out battle for control and accountability.

Frank nodded at the acknowledgment and pressed on. “As an aside, we believe that the technology in this device may have been improperly obtained from my own company, possibly through an executive who is also a board member at the retreat center.”

He paused, fingers drumming against his virtual desk. “We’re examining our civil options, including a broader look at all companies potentially involved in this technology’s development. Several of these entities share… concerning overlaps in ownership and control.” His gaze flickered briefly to Bud. “But for now, knowing this probably stems from theft of hardware and intellectual property should add weight to the administration’s case for action.”

Bud noticed Frank tapping his fingers on the desk, a habitual gesture that felt oddly muted in the silent virtual environment. He watched Frank take a deep breath before continuing. “Finally, and this is perhaps the most troubling, is that all of this is being controlled not by psychologists or medical professionals, but by a closed-source artificial intelligence. While not technically illegal, the AI is alarming. My company uses algorithmic tech in many products, but this isn’t about tracking consumer habits for targeted ads, this is… well, something else entirely.”

Frank’s pause hung in the air, and Bud could sense the ripple of unease that passed through the room. “I think I’ve covered the most significant and actionable points,” Frank added. “But I also want to highlight a few broader implications. Exposing people to this type of radical shift in perception, what essentially amounts to Buddhist enlightenment, could undermine faith in organized religion, destabilize economic participation, and erode the fabric of our democracy. People will become homeless and stop contributing.”

Bud’s eyebrows shot up at the dramatic statement. He couldn’t help but think Frank was exaggerating, but he noted the sober expressions around the room. Maybe this level of emphasis was exactly what they needed to drive home the urgency.

“So where do we start?” someone asked, the realization of the potential scale dawning visibly in his tone. “Can the FDA issue a cease-and-desist, or do we need to pursue relief through the Justice Department for Mr. O’Hearn’s claim of theft?”

Constance’s avatar leaned forward, taking charge. “I’d like us to explore all those avenues and brainstorm any other potential approaches while we’re gathered here. It seems we’re on the same page about needing to put a halt on this technology before more harm is done.”

Lawrence Cray, who had been silent, spoke up. “We’re already three-quarters into fiscal year 2027,” he pointed out, his avatar’s posture shifting forward. “Any large-scale on the books operation will require budget reallocation or a supplemental funding request.”

Constance’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “The timing could work in our favor. Congress is finalizing the FY2028 appropriations. If we act fast, we can incorporate this into the next cycle.”

“Hopefully before they ramp up to mass production and deployment,” Bud said, gesturing toward the large screen as he activated a video clip. Tim Mulvaney’s image appeared, speaking passionately at the conference.

“By enlightenment, I don’t mean mindfulness, or anxiety reduction, or lowering your blood pressure, although all that comes with it. I mean full and complete spiritual enlightenment, being completely awake to reality as it is, like the Buddha…”

=== CHAPTER 17 ===

[SCENE: CH17_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's Office]

Zach swiped his keycard again at the back entrance to his office, the small beep echoing in the quiet alley. He was late again, and walking through the main foyer always felt like announcing it to the world. The locked door didn’t budge, even after a third swipe. A tight knot formed in his stomach. Was the card malfunctioning? He inspected it closely, but nothing looked out of the ordinary.

“Mr. Goodman,” a voice interrupted. Zach flinched slightly and turned to see a security guard rounding the corner.

“Yes,” he said, holding up his keycard with a forced, questioned smile. “It’s not working.”

The guard’s eyes flicked briefly to Zach’s face before stepping forward and swiping his own card. The door clicked open on the first try. “Your keycard has been disabled. Please come with me,” the guard said, his tone unreadable as he held the door open.

Zach’s pulse quickened. He nodded, stepping inside, his feet moving reluctantly as he noticed another guard standing just inside the corridor. “What’s this about?” he asked, trying to keep his voice steady, even as an uneasy chill traced down his spine.

“Chairman O’Hearn and Mr. Perez will explain,” the guard said, giving nothing more. He motioned Zach forward, and the second guard led the way to the elevator.

Zach’s mind raced, his thoughts darting between possibilities. Why would Perez, the CEO himself, need to see him? The knot in his stomach twisted tighter as the elevator ascended, stopping at the top floor.

The lead guard pushed the suite door open, gesturing for Zach to step inside. He walked through, noticing the receptionist already poised by Perez’s office door. She nodded, her expression neutral but eyes flicking with something he couldn’t read. “They’re waiting for you, Mr. Goodman,” she said.

“Thanks, Carol,” Zach murmured, the words catching in his throat as he stepped past her. Inside, Matt Perez sat at the head of the polished table, flanked by Chairman Frank O’Hearn and Guy Whitman, the head of security. A fourth man in an impeccably tailored suit, unfamiliar to Zach, sat across from them. Guy approached and, without a word, took Zach’s laptop from his backpack, setting it on Matt’s desk before indicating the empty chair for him.

“Zach,” Matt began, his voice steady but devoid of warmth. “There’s no easy way to say this, but I wanted you to hear it from me directly. Your employment has been terminated, effective this morning.”

Zach stared, disbelief paralyzing him for a moment. “Fired? On what grounds?” The question slipped out before he could process it. His gaze darted around the table, finally landing on the stranger. “And who is this?”

Matt’s expression didn’t change as he said, “This is Agent Fiona Gile from the Department of Homeland Security. She’s here to consult on an investigation into the misappropriation of company assets.”

“Homeland Security? What exactly am I supposed to have stolen, Matt?” Zach’s voice rose, the tension breaking through despite his best efforts to stay calm. “You’ve known me for how long?”

“Let’s all calm down,” Frank interjected, raising his hands in a placated gesture. The smugness in his eyes said otherwise. “We have reason to believe that you’ve been stealing company intellectual property and sharing it with outside interests.”

“Reason to believe?” Zach echoed, incredulity sharpening his tone. This was surreal. “What outside interests?”

Frank’s smile widened, his eyes glinting with satisfaction. “Do you not sit on the board of a meditation center that’s been clandestinely developing virtual reality content?”

“Clandestinely? What is that supposed to imply?” Zach felt a wave of heat rush over him, making it hard to think. He drew in a deep breath, trying to force some composure back into his fraying thoughts.

Matt shifted, shooting Frank a brief look before focusing back on Zach. “Zach, we have credible evidence that intellectual property—code, schematics, even hardware—has been diverted to the Karmic Protocol project. You must know we monitor all company emails, messaging services, and laptops….”

Zach sagged back into his chair, the weight of the accusation pressing down on him. He exhaled slowly, frustration coursing through him. This was a setup, an elaborate one. Not a single piece of their so-called proprietary code, not one half-baked idea, and certainly not any component of their hardware had made its way into his project.

Across the table, Frank’s grin deepened as he slid a termination notice toward Zach. Zach’s pulse throbbed in his ears. Why was Frank O’Hearn, the Chairman of the board, here for a termination meeting? He hadn’t shown interest in operations like this before. Zach’s mind darted back, grasping for the last time he’d seen Frank, at the virtual reality conference. And then it hit him.

“Bud Turner,” Zach muttered as he slid the notice closer to read it. Of course, it was Turner, who else could have pieced it all together and secured Frank’s ear? It had been Turner who persuaded Carly to send Tim to the conference, setting everything in motion.

“Excuse me?” Agent Gile leaned forward, narrowing her eyes as she strained to catch Zach’s words.

Zach’s gaze snapped to the agent. “Oh no,” he said sharply, pointing at Gile, “without a warrant and my lawyer, I have nothing to say to you.” The moment the words left his mouth, regret prickled at him. The shift in the room was immediate: glances exchanged, subtle nods, an unspoken confirmation of their suspicions. His stomach churned as he realized he still didn’t fully grasp why Homeland Security was involved. Even if every accusation was true, how did it warrant the attention of a federal agency?

With a controlled motion, Zach tossed his keycard onto the table and slipped the folded termination notice into his jacket pocket. “Is that it?” He turned to Guy Whitman. “I assume your team will be escorting me out now?”

“That pleasure will be mine,” Guy said, already rising from his seat.

Zach’s mind whirled, questions tangling as Guy led him out to the elevator and through the front foyer. He felt the eyes of colleagues prickling against him, whispers starting to bubble in his wake. Keeping his expression neutral, he focused inward, grappling with the sequence of events.

Bud Turner had maneuvered Frank O’Hearn into his corner, who then must have convinced Matt Perez that Zach had funneled company resources into developing the Karmic Protocol. But what baffled Zach most was how Turner and O’Hearn had managed to convince Homeland Security that the protocol posed an actual threat to national security.

The door clicked shut behind him as he stepped outside, the chill of reality settling on his skin. Heading toward his car, an unsettling realization flickered in his mind. He did worry that the protocol was a threat, not necessarily to national security, but to an economy built on normal human desire. Maybe, he thought grimly, in a democracy teetering under the weight of its dependencies, an economic threat could be viewed as a national security issue.

The following days blurred by, a storm of frantic calls to lawyers and ignoring the flood of messages from reporters. Despite himself, Zach couldn’t stop checking his phone, though he wasn’t sure what he expected to find. When Joe Bronski’s email finally came through, with its carefully worded questions about neural network architecture, Zach recognized it instantly, a lifeline back to the world he had been yanked away from.

[SCENE: CH17_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Coffee Shop]

A few days later Zach noted the near emptiness of the coffee shop, a setting that calmed his nerves. He sat in the corner, distancing himself from potential eavesdroppers, his personal laptop resting unopened on the table. He watched Joe approach the counter, his friend’s gaze briefly flicking his way. Joe’s expression shifted to a mix of curiosity and concern as he walked over, coffee in hand.

“Bold move meeting in public,” Joe said as he settled into the chair across from Zach, his voice carrying an edge of caution. He glanced at his phone before silencing it.

“They’re watching my place anyway,” Zach said, the weight of O’Hearn’s accusations gnawing at the back of his mind. “Besides, O’Hearn’s too busy today to worry about me. I hear he’s launching some kind of major acquisition.” The bitter edge in his voice wasn’t lost on Joe.

“Yeah, the market’s been crazy. Three different Sato subsidiaries under pressure.” Joe lowered his voice. “The timing’s interesting.” He studied Zach’s face carefully. “You know, O’Hearn’s not just after the protocol. Word is he’s trying to take control of her entire tech portfolio.”

Zach’s jaw tightened. “Using the protocol investigation as cover for a corporate raid. Clever.” He thought about Georgia’s careful maneuvering, her strategic preparation for the protocol’s production. How many fronts was she fighting on now?

“It’s more than clever,” Joe said, leaning forward. “The government investigation gives him perfect cover. Any defensive moves she makes look suspicious. If she tries to protect her assets, it seems like she’s hiding protocol-related evidence. If she focuses on fighting the takeover, the protocol operation becomes vulnerable.”

Zach nodded slowly, pieces clicking into place. “A trap within a trap,” he said. “No wonder she’s been so distracted lately.”

Joe’s nod was small, almost reflexive, as he took a sip of his coffee. “The charges against you are absurd by the way. Anyone who’s even glanced at our codebase would know you didn’t steal anything,” he said. Zach caught the flicker of frustration in Joe’s eyes. “Our neural net couldn’t handle what your team built, even if you had tried.”

Zach leaned forward, the low hum of background noise fading as his focus sharpened. “That’s what I want to talk about. You’re working on the new emotion-recognition systems, right?”

Joe’s brow furrowed. “Yeah, but we’re having problems. Just analyzing emotions takes up so much computing power that our development servers can barely handle it.” He paused, glancing around the room before lowering his voice. “Nothing like what I heard your method could do.”

Zach flipped open his laptop and pivoted it towards Joe. The faint whir of the machine felt louder than it was. “Look at this architecture diagram. Tell me what you see.”

Joe’s eyes scanned the intricate maze of interconnected nodes and pathways. Zach noted the shift in Joe’s expression, the surprise that sharpened into recognition. “This isn’t a traditional neural network,” Joe said, his voice raising an octave. “Is this… quantum-inspired processing with biological feedback loops?”

“Close,” Zach said, the hint of a smile crossing his lips. Memories of countless late nights surfaced as he spoke. “We began with standard deep learning models but found they couldn’t handle consciousness integration. So, we created a hybrid system, reinforcement learning combined with what we call it recursive awareness mapping.”

“The processing requirements must be insane.”

“That’s where the biological feedback comes in,” Zach said, his voice low and steady. He leaned forward, tapping the table with a finger as he spoke. “Instead of processing everything computationally, we let the user’s own neural networks within their brain handle most of the work. The AI just sets the stage and observes.”

Joe leaned back, an incredulous smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He shook his head slowly. “No wonder Bud’s been all over potential platform bans. This is miles ahead of anything out there.” He hesitated, his expression shifting. “One of our freelancers, that Sarah woman, has been digging into this stuff. Three major companies are now fighting over her for code reviews.”

Zach smiled a bit, knowing who he was talking about but not letting Joe know. Sarah had went through the protocol. He was glad she was out there somewhere, still doing what she loved, from an enlightened perspective.

“Speaking of Bud,” Joe circled back, “he’s been asking questions about you.”

Zach felt a familiar tension coil in his chest, though he forced a smirk. “Of course he has. How’s that going?”

Joe’s brow creased, and he glanced at his cup, swirling it absently. “He’s… worried. Not just about the company’s angle. He’s genuinely concerned about what could happen if this tech goes mainstream.”

Zach’s gaze drifted to the laptop as he shut it, the metallic click punctuating a brief silence. He let his eyes wander to the window, where late afternoon sunlight cast fractured reflections across the street. “Funny, isn’t it? I used to be the one pushing for endless testing and safety protocols, always thinking about the consequences. But now…” His voice tapered off, a hint of something unreadable in his expression.

Joe’s voice softened. “What changed?”

A short, humorless laugh escaped Zach’s lips as he began packing up the laptop. “Besides the raids and federal charges?” He stood, the scrape of his chair loud against the floor. “We need to take this conversation somewhere more private. There’s something you need to see, something that will show you why I’m not afraid anymore.”

[SCENE: CH17_S03 | POV: Zach | Location: Joe's Apartment]

The low hum of traffic outside barely registered as Zach stood in the doorway of Joe’s apartment, his eyes adjusting to the dim glow of multiple monitors casting blue light across the cramped space. Research papers crowded the screens: “Quantum Effects in Biological Systems,” “Consciousness as a State of Matter,” “Coherent Quantum States in Neural Networks.” The air was heavy with the sharp scent of stale coffee, an untouched mug sitting forgotten on the desk.

Zach stepped inside, Joe leading the way and quickly becoming absorbed in the tangled mess of notes and highlighted articles spread before him. Zach’s eyes narrowed, recognizing the architecture diagrams from their earlier meeting, the ones Joe had struggled to grasp at first. But now, the focus in Joe’s expression hinted at a breakthrough.

“Seeing the bigger picture yet?” Zach’s voice cut through the silence, startling Joe. He glanced over his shoulder, a flicker of surprise melting into weariness.

Joe exhaled as if he’d been holding his breath. “I think I’m starting to piece it together, but it’s… a lot.”

Zach nodded, stepping further into the room, his gaze moving from the glowing screens to Joe’s furrowed brow. “It is a lot,” Zach said, crossing his arms. “But you’re seeing it, aren’t you? The protocol isn’t just tech, it’s a framework for consciousness to observe itself.”

Joe looked back at the computer screens, both excited and confused. “So the quantum patterns... the way they stay connected through feedback loops. It’s like holding up a mirror to your own mind, without messing it up.”

“Exactly,” Zach said with a small smile. All those hours defending his ideas finally felt worth it, sitting here in Joe’s messy apartment. “Normal computers try to measure these special brain patterns but end up breaking them in the process. What our protocol does is different. It uses signals from your body to keep these delicate patterns working, even while we’re watching them.”

Joe’s face changed as he finally understood. He relaxed, his eyes going a bit distant as he thought about it. “So the eye-tracking cameras and the brain sensors aren’t just collecting information. They’re actually part of this special connection between the person watching and what they’re watching.”

Zach moved closer, speaking more softly. “That’s right. When people reach these special mental states, their brain patterns naturally form these quantum connections. Our system notices when this happens and gives tiny hints to help keep it going. You can’t force it to happen, just like you can’t force yourself to fall asleep. You just create the right conditions and let the mind find its way there.”

Joe held his cold coffee cup but didn’t drink from it. He turned to Zach with eyes full of wonder and questions. “If this is really true... if our minds actually work using quantum rules, then this isn’t just a cool gadget, is it? It’s...”

“A window,” Zach finished for him, his voice almost reverent. “A window into the nature of awareness itself.”

They stood in silence, the hum of the monitors underscoring the unspoken implications.

=== CHAPTER 18 ===

[SCENE: CH18_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Hotel Room]

Tim sat in a hotel room, waiting for Finn to returned from checking things at the retreat center. A sharp knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. He crossed the room with practiced ease and opened it, eyes narrowing as Jessica entered, balancing a tray of coffees.

“Nice hotel, Tim. Didn’t know you went in for this kind of luxury,” she remarked, placing the tray on the small counter near the entrance. Tim’s lips twitched, acknowledging the subtle jab without a reply, it was clearly not a nice hotel.

“Jessica, good to see you. How are things at the warehouse?” Tim’s voice was even, but he scrutinized her face for any sign of trouble.

“Per your cryptic orders, I didn’t stop there,” Jessica said, taking a cautious sip. Her tone was laced with curiosity. “Why are we meeting here, anyway?”

Tim allowed a smile to surface. “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you,” he said, a hint of humor in his voice as he reached for the TV remote and switched it off. Silence hummed between them for a moment.

“Any news?” Jessica’s question cut through the pause as he sank onto the sofa. Tim caught her eyes flicker with unease.

“Nope,” Tim replied, pulling out the rolling chair from the desk and sitting down.

“No news is good news, right?” Jessica offered, but Tim wasn’t ready to let his guard down.

“Not necessarily,” Tim countered, letting the coffee warm his hands before taking a deliberate sip. “Are we still on track to start the first production run this week?” His tone brooked no uncertainty.

“Yes indeed. How is the software piece coming along?” Jessica’s question was direct, and Tim noted the slight shift in his stance, as if anticipating a problem.

“Swimmingly,” Tim said, a brief nod toward the desk where two laptops sat, programs running ceaselessly. The subtle hum of technology pulsed in the room.

He looked at Jessica with a hint of pride in his smile. The two of them, alongside Finn, made up the core group they called the dharmapalas, protectors of the protocol. They had allies—volunteers from Jeta’s Grove, others from the retreat center, and trusted friends—but here, in this room, was the heart of their mission.

Their task was twofold: mass-produce the karmic protocol and defend it from those who would suppress it. This was imperative to ensure that anyone who wanted enlightenment could attain it.

Jessica’s gaze sharpened as she changed topics, launching into her real report. “It didn’t take long for my position in policy at the state senate to bear fruit,” she began, eyes flicking briefly to Tim. “A friend in the Governor’s office just tipped me off, they’ve been briefed about an imminent danger involving an untested virtual reality program. Apparently, it uses stolen technology to scramble people’s brains.”

Tim’s jaw tightened. “Scramble people’s brains? Stolen technology?”

Who stole technology? Tim thought.

“Briefed by who?” Tim’s question cut through the room.

Jessica’s gaze was steady, but the news seemed to weigh on the room. “Briefed by none other than the Department of Homeland Security,” she said. “I don’t have any materials, and I’m not likely to get access. It’s not an issue for the legislature yet. I only know what my friend has heard, and it’s not good.”

Tim’s mind worked fast, cataloging possibilities. Jessica’s voice dropped an octave as she continued. “Homeland Security has one of the retreat center’s awakened ones. I’m not sure which one, but apparently, whoever it is has been cooperating with the investigation.”

“Probably not cooperating as much as being open and honest,” Tim said, the words coming out as more of a grim acknowledgment than surprise. His jaw clenched subtly; this was a complication they couldn’t afford.

Tim’s hand tightened on the arm of the chair, his concern growing as he continued. “They already had my name from the conference,” he said, the edge in his voice giving way to a resigned sigh. “This confirms my paranoia.”

Jessica’s eyes widened. “Hence why you’re staying here and not going to either the retreat center or the manufacturing facility lately.”

“I’d better warn Finn!” Tim’s abrupt exclamation made her gaze snapped up. She watched Tim fumble for his phone, urgency taking hold of the room.

“Oh boy,” Tim said, cutting into the tension. He met Jessica’s eyes with a sharp nod. “Best he doesn’t come here or go to the facility, not straight from the retreat center, at least. If they have eyes on the place, we can’t afford that risk.”

His fingers were already dialing, his movements jerky with nervous energy. Tim noticed Jessica holding her breath, the new reality sinking in.

Tim rubbed a hand over his eyes, fatigue battling with adrenaline. He took another sip of his coffee as he waited for Finn to answer, the lukewarm liquid doing little to steady him.

Jessica pulled off the baseball cap she’d been wearing, and her long, curly brown hair cascaded around her shoulders. Tim caught the hint of defiance in her mock salute as she started to talk again as he waited on the phone. “Homeland Security isn’t the only agency involved. They’re labeling it an unlicensed medical device, claiming the tech and code were stolen from some big VR company, and that it’s illegally gathering biometric data on the populace.”

Tim’s outburst was immediate. “What a bunch of crap! On all counts!” He waved his phone, frustration etched across his face. “Finn’s not picking up.”

“We can’t count on any of these agencies to hold to the truth if their goal is to shut down the protocol,” he said, his voice measured but firm. The weight of the situation pressed on him, demanding clarity. “We need to contact Georgia and ensure the production facility is secure. They probably think Zach stole the tech from his own company. If we can’t reach Finn, maybe we should reach out to Carly and check if any of these agencies have been in touch with her.”

Jessica set down her coffee, the ceramic clinking sharply against the table. She began pacing, the lines on her face deepening with worry. “This is really happening, they are really rounding up people involved.” she muttered, disbelief mixing with fear.

Tim took a step toward her, a laugh breaking through his tension. He slung an arm around Jessica’s shoulders. “We planned for this,” he said, the smile forced but necessary. The reassurance lingered in the air like a promise they both wanted to believe. Yet beneath that thin veneer, Tim knew they hadn’t planned for coordinated action against the protocol to come this soon or with this level of threat.

Tim’s phone buzzed, sharp and urgent, pulling their attention. Relief and apprehension flickered across his face as he glanced at the screen. “It’s Finn,” he announced before connecting the call. Jessica fell silent, eyes locked on Tim as he listened, brows knitting tighter with each passing second.

“Homeland Security did what?” Tim’s voice rose, echoing their collective anxiety as the torrent of Finn’s words flooded the line.

=== CHAPTER 19 ===

[SCENE: CH19_S01 | POV: Carly | Location: Jeta's Grove]

“They’re already here,” Carly replied when she got Zach’s frantic call. “They’re almost finished. They seized everything, gave me a cease-and-desist order.”

“I’m on my way,” Zach replied, “Anyone hurt?”

“No, no, no,” Carly assured him, “They’ve been very professional, and we’ve been very compliant.”

“Did they show you a warrant?” he asked.

“Yes, I called our attorney, and he was able to speak to one of the agents and everything appears to be ok for now,” Carly answered, noticing some commotion in the next room. “Listen, let’s talk when you get here, I’ve got to go.”

“Ok, I should be there in about an hour.”

An entire team of agents had shown up at the retreat center at Jeta’s Grove that morning and immediately started asking questions and gathering everything that appeared to them to be related to the protocol. Luckily, most of the meditators were in the large meditation hall when they came in, so the initial shock of the visit was limited to Carly and a few of the front office workers. It still seemed like a nightmare as she shook her head, put the phone back into her pocket, and went to find out what the ruckus was about.

“They’ve asked Ed to come with them and he’s agreed,” someone exclaimed as she entered the next room and saw a few of the residents standing around Ed, looking as if they were trying to protect him from the agents.

“He shouldn’t go,” another person shouted, “they have no right to take him!”

Carly was torn. She couldn’t stop him, and it may look bad if she tried. On the other hand, Ed knew almost everything about the retreat center, and surely, he’d be more than happy to be honest with anyone who questioned him. 

“Please,” Carly interjected, moving into the middle of the crowd, “Ed is more than capable of making his own decisions and looking after himself.”

The group that had gathered looked surprised and upset Carly seemed to be taking the wrong side. “Do you mind if I tag along, Ed?” she asked, then looked toward the agent who was trying to lead him out, “Would that be alright, Agent Gile?”

Agent Gile had been one of the more reasonable and approachable ones during what Carly couldn’t help but think of as a raid. She also seemed to be a senior agent, so Carly hoped she was the right one to ask.

“Sure, that would be fine,” Agent Gile replied as she turned to lead them out of the center. She reached for a small device that looked like an old walkie talkie and said, “Two to transport.”

=== CHAPTER 20 ===

[SCENE: CH20_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

“Just five working headsets?” Bud asked Constance over the video feed, disbelief tightening his jaw. He had sneaked down to his home office for the call, ignoring the stern warnings from his wife about staying away from work during paternity leave. His other screen silently scrolled market alerts, “Advent Industries’ latest aggressive moves against Sato’s tech portfolio.”

“A few others in various stages of completion, but only five they claimed were functional,” Constance said, a slight shrug in her voice. Bud noted how even over video, her confidence came through. “Their notes were meticulous, though. The logs showed exactly who went through the protocol and which headset each person used. For amateurs, their diligence was surprising.”

Bud’s brow furrowed. “No sign of a larger manufacturing setup? No hidden facility on the property?”

“Nothing,” she confirmed. “They kept everything confined to one room in the basement. They even maintained a sign-in sheet for anyone who entered that space. This wasn’t some sprawling, clandestine operation. It was slow, deliberate, and limited.”

Bud processed the information, mentally tallying the implications. “So, only 27 people subjected to the protocol as far as we know,” he said, his mind turning over the possibility. If that were true, then where could they have scaled up production? They must be scaling this. It didn’t add up.

“The hermitage at Jeta’s Grove turned out clean,” Constance added, breaking his train of thought. “No headsets, no notes, nothing electronic at all. Homeland Security’s search of the place confirmed our intel, it’s just a secluded area where a few of them practiced and taught Buddhism.”

Bud clenched his teeth. It felt wrong, incomplete. There had to be more.

“Anything on Georgia Sato?” Constance’s voice cut through the silence that had stretched between them.

“No,” Bud said, shaking his head. Frustration tightened his chest. “She donated the land, visited the retreat, but there’s no trace of any other ties. I’m trying to pull strings, get some colleagues to dig through her business holdings. But she’s careful, possibly even better connected than I am. Her reputation’s flawless, or it was until O’Hearn started his takeover bid.”

“Well,” Constance said, her tone shifting, “nothing’s come up in the search for unusual microchip purchases. Your list of required goods for mass production was solid, though. Our partners are staying vigilant.” She paused, but Bud could tell she was choosing her next words carefully. “Of course, with O’Hearn attempting to gain control of several semiconductor companies in Sato’s portfolio, tracking chip production will get… complicated.”

Bud leaned back, the creak of the chair loud in the stillness of his office. Were they heading this off before it exploded into something unmanageable?

“It seems like we’re doing everything possible right now,” Constance continued. “The cease-and-desist order is active, the hardware’s confiscated, and we’re questioning everyone involved while keeping watch on potential associates.”

“How about Zach Goodman?” Bud pressed, his voice firm as he steered the conversation back on track. “Has he been brought in yet on the criminal charges?”

Constance shook her head, her gaze shifting down as if reviewing something on her desk. “Not yet. O’Hearn’s legal team is pushing hard, but with his corporate moves making headlines, the prosecutors are worried about the appearance of coordination. Another way he may be shooting himself in the foot. Official line… they’re still drafting the charges and clearing the warrant. It’s taking time, they want to make sure everything’s airtight.”

Bud swallowed, searching for the right words to frame his next question. “So, did they, uh, find what O’Hearn suspected they would?”

“Yes,” Constance confirmed, her voice dropping to a hushed tone. “Evidence linking the origins of the protocol to Goodman’s company was secured at the retreat center.”

Bud nodded slowly. He hadn’t entirely supported Frank’s push to implicate Goodman, but for now, it seemed to be going smoothly. At the very least, it would tie up Zach in legal battles, keeping him out of their way while prosecutors unraveled the complexities.

“And Tim Mulvaney?” Bud pressed, a frown forming.

“No trace,” Constance replied, her tone edged with frustration. “Witnesses and the evidence suggest he left the retreat center right after the conference and hasn’t been seen at his residence or the Sato property since we began our search.”

Bud’s attention shifted when he caught movement at the doorway. Cheryl stood there, cradling their newborn son. A surge of guilt and warmth rushed through him. He hurriedly ended the call with Constance. “I’ll check in later,” he muttered, clicking off the video feed.

“Cheryl,” he said, moving quickly to close the distance between them.

“Don’t you Cheryl me, Freeman Turner,” she said, her voice as cold as it was resolute. Bud’s stomach tightened; she only used his full name when he was in trouble. “You’re supposed to be on parental leave. You’ve got the ‘paternity’ part down, but the ‘leave’ part seems to be slipping your mind.”

Bud managed a half-smile. “Would it help if I said it wasn’t work?”

The silence that followed answered for her. Her expression softened as she unwrapped their son and placed the baby into his arms.

“Well, it certainly sounded like work,” she said, a hint of a smile starting to form. “George Turner and I deserve your undivided attention. Before long, you’ll be back at work, and these moments won’t come so easily.”

Bud glanced down at the tiny fingers gripping his thumb. Cheryl’s gentle touch as she cooed at the baby warmed the moment. “Isn’t that right, little Georgy?” she murmured.

He walked with her out of the office, heading toward the living room. “George,” he corrected, giving her a mock-serious look. The nickname “Georgy” rubbed him the wrong way, though he couldn’t quite said why. Maybe it was the way he bristled at being called “Buddy” himself, a name no one really used but still irked him. It was a harmless annoyance, an excuse to tease him.

“Isn’t that right, Georgy Porgy?” Cheryl countered, laughter dancing in her eyes.

Bud groaned theatrically. “Hey! That’s worse!”

=== CHAPTER 21 ===

[SCENE: CH21_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Spa]

That evening, Zach Goodman found himself back at the spa, settling into the sensory deprivation tank. He had already paid for the sessions, and with no job and the looming shadow of possible civil and criminal trials, there wasn’t much else occupying his time.

Even here, in the dark, soundproof bath of salt water that had always been his sanctuary, thoughts of the planted evidence and the fabricated charges that had led to his arrest gnawed at him. The quiet embrace of the tank did little to silence the storm in his mind. He felt sure that his allotted time was almost over, yet his brain refused to stop replaying the events of the past couple of weeks.

His toe brushed the side of the chamber, and he nudged off gently, letting himself drift back to the center. Despite everything, a strange calm had seeped into him. Now that his worst fears had come true, there was an unexpected serenity in facing the known. His mind, however, remained restless, rifling through every possible outcome, every solution that eluded him.

The protocol was out of his reach for now. They had confiscated everything from the center and his home, leaving him barred from any further work, not just because of the cease-and-desist order but as a strict condition of his bail. He couldn’t deny the small relief of being outside a cell, a freedom he owed to his lawyer. Zach had never liked lawyers much, but now, he was thankful one had been in his corner when it mattered most.

A soft tone chimed, signaling the end of his session. He stretched, a yawn escaping him, and wondered if he’d managed to drift off even briefly. Sleep had been hard to come by lately, an expected side effect of his predicament. As he rinsed off and dressed, he noted the subtle shift within him, something steadier had taken root, though the anger and frustration lingered beneath the surface. He knew it would take time to fully come to terms with the resentment he still harbored.

While walking through the spa waiting room, the front desk attendant waved him over.

“Mr. Goodman!” she called, holding up a package. “This was dropped off for you while you were floating.”

“Thank you,” he said, taking the package. He studied it for any clue as to what it contained or who had sent it.

“It came by courier,” the attendant added, noticing his confusion.

“Ok, well, have a good night,” he replied, a slight smile breaking through as he turned and walked to his car.

[SCENE: CH21_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's Car]

Seated in the driver’s seat, Zach opened the package. His brows furrowed when he saw it contained a simple, cheap cell phone. There was no note, no return address, nothing to indicate who had sent it or why. The fact that someone knew he would be at the spa at this specific time, especially since he’d booked the session on a whim, sent a shiver through him.

The sudden ring of the phone made him flinch, his pulse quickening. For an instant, he considered tossing it out the window, letting it tumble across the highway median. But whoever had arranged for this had gone to great lengths to reach him. With a deep breath, he picked up.

“Hello?” he said, his voice edged with hesitation, the rush of anticipation tightening his chest.

“Zach! Glad you got my gift.” The voice on the other end was unmistakable: Tim Mulvaney. Zach’s mind raced, he hadn’t heard from Tim since the conference, and in the whirlwind of recent events, he hadn’t stopped to question the silence. Things must be dire if Tim need to resort to such elaborate measures to talk to him.

“Did you lose my regular cell phone number?” Zach asked, the question slipping out before he could contain his sarcasm.

Tim’s voice took on a familiar wry tone. “Hey, my abundance of caution has paid off every step of the way since the protocol went public. How are you holding up?”

Zach felt his jaw tighten. “How am I holding up?” he echoed, the frustration bubbling over. “Well, let’s see: because of our little project, I’ve lost my job, been arrested on charges of corporate espionage and a slew of other accusations I don’t fully understand. Oh, and I’m probably unhireable in my field. And now, thanks to this,” he gestured at the phone, knowing Tim couldn’t see, “it seems either one or both of us are under constant surveillance. I’m not sure I’m holding up at all.”

“At least you got some time in the tank,” Tim said, a short laugh escaping before he caught himself. “Listen, I don’t know who’s watching whom, or if anyone really is, but I needed to talk to you, and this was the best way my extremely paranoid mind could come up with.”

Zach couldn’t help a slight smirk at that. The humor, however strained, was a welcome reprieve. “Why do you need to talk to me?”

“I figured we should exchange information,” Tim continued. “Not sure if you heard, but they raided the hermitage section of Jetta’s Grove too, in addition to the retreat center portion. Apparently, some of our enlightened friends have been brought in for questioning.”

Zach’s stomach tightened. “The hermitage I hadn’t heard about,” he said, the unease creeping further in. “I imagine when they only found five working prototypes at the center, they assumed we were starting mass production out there.”

Tim let out a nervous chuckle. “Yeah, well, they didn’t find anything because there was nothing to find.”

Zach’s thoughts raced. “Did they take any of the others in?”

“Oddly enough, no,” Tim replied. “They had names from the notes they seized at the retreat center. But here’s the strange part: those who were there say that even though the others were right in plain sight, the agents didn’t approach them, didn’t question them, almost as if they didn’t see them at all.”

Zach couldn’t suppress a wry grin. “That’s just what we need, miracles of invisibility in the middle of a federal investigation.”

Tim ignored the comment and pressed on. “Oh, I almost forgot to mention,” he added, as if remembering an afterthought. “The phone isn’t the only present I got you.”

Zach raised an eyebrow, half-expecting another wild twist. “Don’t tell me you left a 3d printed gun at my therapist’s office,” he joked, letting out a dry laugh. Tim joined in, the shared humor lightening the tension for a moment.

“Even better,” Tim said, a note of excitement in his voice. “With the help of Ms. Sato, I managed to get you a lawyer, a good one, to support the one you had to scramble to hire.”

“Georgia Sato?” Zach’s eyes widened, skepticism mingled with surprise. “I know she donated the land, and has meditated with us, but why would she help you help me?” He caught himself and quickly added, “Not that I’m not grateful.”

Tim’s tone shifted, more serious now. “We’ve been working on a little project of our own,” he said. “And we’re going to need your help to finish it.”

=== CHAPTER 22 ===

[SCENE: CH22_S01 | POV: Fiona | Location: Boardroom]

“We could force our enemies to go through this protocol after they are defeated so that they remain peaceful and docile for the remainder of their lives under our rule,” Constance Henning said, her tone exaggerated. Fiona Gile sat across the room, her attention flicking to Under Secretary Cray. She knew he’d been steering every meeting about the protocol with increasing intensity since the first raid. Constance’s quip was meant to knock him off balance.

Cray’s eyebrows lifted, as if weighing the outlandish suggestion. Gile caught the flicker in his eyes, a calculation. He was already thinking ahead, probably about stricter controls or legislation. She shared his frustration at the slow-moving bureaucracy but doubted anything would change until the situation grew worse.

“If we force this on people, we’re just as bad as Goodman and his cronies,” another official cut in, their voice edged with righteousness. The likely made up rumor that the retreat center had coerced participants into using the protocol clung stubbornly to every conversation, despite Gile’s own understanding that the evidence said otherwise.

“Obviously, I was joking,” Constance shot back, the irony in her voice sharp. “Weaponization, or any use at all of this thing is in contradiction to the administration’s direct orders.”

“So far,” Cray muttered. Gile could sense the tension between them and knew this verbal sparring was more than just a power play, it was a battle over how far they were willing to go.

“Really, Larry?” Constance’s tone dripped with condescension, the use of his first name intentional. Gile watched Cray’s jaw tighten. He was not one to be taken down a notch easily.

“Madame Commissioner,” Cray replied, voice precise, “The prototypes, codes, programs and notes are all impounded. By you. At your facility. Let’s stay focused on the operation against this potential manufacturing site of Ms. Sato’s, which, as you know, is a priority for the administration. We still have no clue where it is.” His words were clipped, but he was right. Gile had seen the dossiers and knew they had little room for error.

Constance’s mouth twitched, and Gile sensed the weight of her frustration. Bud Turner’s involvement had been the catalyst for this entire operation spiraling out of control. Now, every government branch, private entity, and even some religious factions were circling like vultures, each with their own agenda. The room felt charged, the air thick with tension and a slew of baseless theories: rogue AI, societal pacification, the fall of major institutions.

Clearing her throat, Gile leaned forward. “If I may, Madame Commissioner,” she said, conscious of every eye turning to her. The nod from Constance was permission enough. Gile spoke confidently, outlining the operation she’d meticulously planned.

“We believe this is where Mulvaney and Sato have begun mass production of the protocol virtual reality hardware,” she said, the steady rhythm of her voice anchoring the room as she pointed to a map. “We need to be fast, covert, and thorough. Our goal is to take the protocol off the streets for good before it has the chance to spread.”

She paused, scanning the faces around the table, gauging their reactions. The stakes were high, and Gile knew that at this moment, precision and resolve were their only allies.

=== CHAPTER 23 ===

[SCENE: CH23_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Warehouse]

Zach stood at the end of the assembly line, unable to suppress the awe tightening his chest as hundreds of virtual reality headsets glimmered under the overhead lights, each one waiting for its final programming. It felt surreal, almost impossible, even with the proof right in front of him. The “KP” etched into the side caught his eye—an unexpectedly refined touch, considering their compressed timeline.

“Jesus Christ,” Zach murmured, taking a step back, the expletive slipping out as disbelief gave way to wonder.

“Not exactly,” Tim said with a chuckle, lifting one headset and pressing it into Zach’s hands. From across the room, a news alert flashed on one of the monitors. “Advent Industries Calls Emergency Shareholder Meeting. Vote on Sato Tech Acquisition Expected.”

Tim’s expression hardened before he gestured toward the assembly line. “We’ve got forty-eight hours before O’Hearn’s team of lawyers start filing their injunctions against any and all of Georgia’s holdings. Every minute counts.”

Zach examined the device, turning it over in his hands as he and Tim walked along the assembly line. The surreal nature of the scene still clung to him, a lingering echo of the convoluted journey that had brought him here. The cab ride, the shift into a nondescript van, the circuitous drive that twisted through seemingly nowhere, and the final rush into the back of a box truck, all of it had felt like an elaborate smuggling operation. Now he understood it wasn’t just about avoiding government surveillance.

“Are these the retinal scanners that are in the headsets?” Zach asked, catching sight of the lens station as they moved past it.

“Yup,” Tim replied, a glint of pride in his eyes. “And those special audio components you wanted.” He gestured further down the line, where engineers worked meticulously. “Securing those wasn’t exactly quiet. This isn’t just an assembly line, Zach. Each unit goes through precise calibration, quantum sensors, neural interface testing, sub-millisecond response checks. One misaligned part, and the whole thing’s scrap. And we can’t afford delays, not with corporate lawyers and Homeland Security circling.”

Zach nodded, the gesture automatic, before turning to the thick pane of glass that revealed another room with a complete microchip fabricator, something he’d only glimpsed on rare overseas trips with company executives.

“Our clean room,” Tim said, his voice breaking through Zach’s reverie. “Slowest part of the process, and the hardest to keep supplied.”

“No bulk microchip orders to trace,” Zach whispered, the realization settling over him like a revelation. It was barely believable they could put a fab like this together, yet here it was.

“Plus, a helpful solar panel facility happened to have surplus silicon shipped off the books,” Tim added with a grin.

“You’ve really thought of everything,” Zach said, genuine admiration threading through his voice. The irony hit him. Months ago, he’d have balked at such mass production, haunted by the memory of the raid on the retreat center that had been treated like a bomb factory. Losing his job and facing arrest had changed him; now, all he could feel was a sharp thrill coursing through his veins.

“This must be costing a fortune!” Zach said, the enormity of the operation dawning on him. “Especially now with…” He trailed off, thinking of the market alerts he’d seen about O’Hearn’s aggressive stock purchases.

“Courtesy of Ms. Sato,” Tim replied. A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he spoke, but his fingers drummed against the tabletop, his shoulders rigid beneath his casual shirt. “Through shell companies, straw men and a maze of financial defenses that’s getting more complex by the day. She’s fighting a war on two fronts. Keeping O’Hearn’s corporate raiders from tracking these resources while preventing government scrutiny from freezing her assets.”

“The facility wasn’t built overnight,” Tim continued. Zach saw a look of pride mixing with urgency. “Georgia’s been quietly acquiring equipment and setting up the fabrication line since early 2026. Each component bought through different subsidiaries, shipped to various shell companies, finally brought here. But O’Hearn’s takeover attempt is forcing her to accelerate everything - moving assets, restructuring ownership, protecting supply chains. We’re in a race now.”

Zach stepped closer to the fabrication equipment, the gleam of polished metal and intricate networks of wires drawing him in. “The silicon wafer processing alone must’ve taken weeks to calibrate. If O’Hearn gains control of her tech companies…”

“Exactly,” Tim confirmed, a grim smile forming as he leaned against a nearby workstation. “That’s why we started the test runs three months ago, masked as solar panel production. The first chip that met our standards came off the line six weeks back, right when the heat started turning up at the retreat center. We knew we’d need a head start.”

“And the custom audio components?” Zach asked, eyes shifting to the assembly line.

Tim’s smile widened, though fatigue showed at its edges. “They’ve been in the works even longer. A small manufacturer in Arizona that Georgia took over last year has been handling those - one of the companies O’Hearn’s trying to acquire now. Everything’s been moving in parallel, but we’re running out of time. Once he gains enough board seats…”

He left the implications hanging. Zach couldn’t help but admire the intricate dance Georgia was performing, using corporate structures to shield the protocol while preventing those same structures from falling into hostile hands.

[SCENE: CH23_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Warehouse]

“Come,” Tim said, motioning him to follow. They made their way down the corridor toward the front of the building, where they stepped into a room that bristled with quiet tension. Screens glowed with feeds from security cameras that monitored the perimeter and the main floor. Two women sat at a control panel, eyes darting between monitors, fingers poised.

“Everything set?” Tim asked.

“Sure thing,” one of the women replied, focus unbroken. “We’ll be ready.”

Tim motioned for Zach to follow him to a table tucked into the far corner of the room. Zach’s mind raced, trying to piece together what they were preparing for as he watched Tim settle into a chair.

“I have to make a small confession, Zach,” Tim said, his tone serious.

Zach let out a short laugh, a half-hearted attempt to diffuse the sudden tension. “That’s for sure!”

Tim didn’t react to the joke. “Remember when you said they’d seized all five of the working prototypes from the retreat center?”

“Yes,” Zach replied slowly, his brow furrowing as he tried to predict where this was leading.

Without another word, Tim reached into a nearby box and pulled out a headset. The number “5” was etched on its side.

Zach’s eyes widened in recognition. “Finn!” he blurted out, the realization dawning that they had deceived him that day when he’d thought the fifth headset was missing.

“Bingo,” Tim confirmed, placing the prototype carefully on the table. His expression softened. “I’m sorry I didn’t bring you in on this from the beginning.”

Zach felt a wave of relief mixed with something deeper, an understanding. He raised a hand, dismissing the apology. “No, Tim. You were right not to.”

Tim’s face clouded with regret. “I’m sorry you’re the one taking the brunt of all this.”

The weight of that truth pressed down on Zach’s chest. He sighed, the reality of his situation crashing back into his mind. His career, his reputation, everything had been upended.

Tim’s voice broke the silence, lower now, almost uncertain. “The truth is, I might have exaggerated my familiarity and expertise when it comes to programming this AI,” he admitted, eyes dropping to the table.

Zach leaned back slightly, absorbing the implication. “You need me to program the artificial intelligence that will run all of these.”

Tim’s head moved side to side, a wry smile appearing. “I could probably program them, sure. But not efficiently, and definitely not without mistakes.”

“You might not believe this,” Zach said, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips, “but aside from having nothing to do until my first court date, I’ve actually had a plan for this knocking around my head for quite a while.”

Tim’s eyes lit up. “Now you’re talking! I know you didn’t bring along an overnight bag, but given the circumstances, it might be best if you stay here with us, if you don’t mind a cot.”

A tired laugh escaped Zach. “A cot never sounded so good,” he said just as Finn walked in, his expression a mix of relief and unease.

“Did you break the news to him?” Finn asked, his voice low, eyes darting away.

Tim nodded. “Yes.”

Zach stood up and gave him a nod. “You pulled it off,” he said, extending a hand. “I knew I wasn’t losing my mind.”

Finn’s grin was sheepish as he shook Zach’s hand. “We were just lucky number five wasn’t scheduled to be used anytime soon. It’s good to see you.”

He stepped forward, a lopsided smile breaking through as he clasped Zach’s hand. “Looks like you’re officially a dharmapala now.”

“A what?” Zach asked, the unfamiliar word tugging at his curiosity.

“A guardian of the dharma,” Tim interjected, a subtle pride in his tone. “That’s what our little band started calling themselves.”

“Dharmapala,” Zach repeated, savoring the sound. The name resonated somewhere deep within him, sparking an unexpected warmth. “I like the ring of that.”

Before the moment could settle, an alarm blared, sharp and intrusive, cutting through the room like a knife. The monitors went dark, the sudden blackness twisting Zach’s gut. A second later, the screens blinked back on, lines of static resolving into the familiar array of video feeds.

“We have movement at the perimeter,” one of the women monitoring security called out, her chair rolling back as she gestured to the main feed. Zach’s eyes locked onto the screen showing several black vehicles racing toward the gate, now ominously ajar.

A chill ran down his spine. Whatever was coming, it wouldn’t be good.

=== CHAPTER 24 ===

[SCENE: CH24_S01 | POV: Fiona | Location: SUV]

Agent Gile sat in the back of one of the black SUVs racing toward the manufacturing facility. Gile’s gaze swept over the line of vehicles in the caravan, each one blending seamlessly into the mundane. The radio on her shoulder crackled.

“Zach Goodman was able to lose his tail this morning. There’s a chance he may be at the facility.

 Gile’s pulse quickened at the news.

As they neared the front gate, Gile’s eyes narrowed. It was open, which set off a warning deep in her gut. Something wasn’t right.

“Any unusual traffic in or out this morning?” she asked, keeping her tone even.

“Box truck went into the loading dock, no visual on what it contained,” came the response. “And one private vehicle, three occupants, one male, two female.” The gender detail seemed irrelevant, but Gile let it slide.

“Let’s get this over with,” she muttered, signaling the driver to proceed. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught another agent’s nod. They all shared the same unease. At least they wouldn’t need biohazard suits this time, she thought, recalling the nerve-wracking chemical weapon bust in Arizona two years ago.

[SCENE: CH24_S02 | POV: Fiona | Location: Tablet Factory]

The vehicles fanned out as they passed the fence and came to a halt. Gile stepped out, feeling the chill in the air bite through her suit. She drew the warrant from her breast pocket as they approached the front entrance. Other agents moved into position, spreading around the perimeter. It wasn’t a ‘guns-out’ raid; intelligence had suggested no armed resistance. Still, she knew better than to underestimate a situation.

The receptionist’s eyes widened as they swept into the foyer. Her hand trembled as she stammered, “Hello, can I help you?”

“We have a cease-and-desist and a warrant to search the premises,” Gile said, holding the papers aloft without offering them. Gile kept her focus sharp as agents split off, carrying evidence boxes, and moving deeper into the building. Gile “Just stay at your workstation and cooperate with the agents. They’ll be collecting evidence.”

Gile led a handful of agents through two sets of double doors and out onto the factory floor. The sight that met her eyes was entirely unexpected. There was no assembly line churning out virtual reality headsets; instead, rows of bright, colorful tablet computers were being assembled.

In the center of the room stood Georgia Sato, surrounded by a group of well-dressed people, multiple cameras, and, to Gile’s dismay, about a dozen children. For fuck’s sake, she thought, forcing herself to keep her expression neutral.

Before she could adjust the radio clipped to her vest, a voice crackled over it. “This box truck appears to be a school bus.”

The timing was perfect, perfectly disastrous. Damn, damn, damn. She shot a glance at another agent, who responded with a resigned shrug.

“What is the meaning of this?” one of the suited men near Sato demanded, his voice slicing through the murmurs in the room.

Gile took a steadying breath as she descended the short flight of steps onto the factory floor, acutely aware of the cameras trained on her. Where the hell was her partner? A quick glance confirmed he had stayed behind, leaving her to face the spectacle alone.

“I am Agent Fiona Gile with Homeland Security,” she announced, her voice firm but controlled, “and we have a warrant to search these premises for illegal medical devices.”

Georgia Sato’s eyes widened in what seemed like exaggerated surprise. “Please cooperate with the agents, everyone,” Sato said in a calm, commanding tone. “I’m sure there is an explanation for this. As you can see, we have no illegal medical devices here, only tablets for toddlers.” She raised the tablet in her hand, turning it so the agents could see.

Gile’s jaw tightened as Sato shifted to face the gathering. The scene became more complicated by the second.

“Senators, I am so sorry for this intrusion,” Sato said, gesturing for the adults and children to move closer together. “Could you have one of your agents escort the children and my guests to the conference room while we work out this horrible mistake you’ve made?”

A chill ran down Gile’s spine. This was spiraling fast, and the stakes had just become painfully clear.

Gile nodded, a subtle acknowledgment, though she felt helpless gnawing. With a glance, she signaled to her partner to guide the group down the hall. As the children and their escorts shuffled out, a young woman stepped forward, handing Gile a business card.

“Agent Gile, please forward a copy of that warrant and any other information regarding this mess to Senator Yost’s office at your earliest convenience,” the woman said, nodding toward one of the men in suits standing in the line. Gile’s eyes dropped to the card: Jessica Everett, staffer at the State Senate. Tucking the card into her pocket, Gile felt a sharp pang as she noticed the cameras were still recording, capturing everything.

“Can we please put those away now and have you all accompany the others into the conference room?” she said, keeping her tone measured but firm, eyes sweeping over the group of onlookers who lingered, cameras still raised.

Georgia’s voice rang out before Gile could get a response. “I’m not sure that is entirely necessary,” Sato interjected, gesturing for two of the men with handheld cameras to remain. “This is being broadcast live. I’m sure those watching would love to know how this ends.”

Gile clenched her jaw. The rest of the day unfolded as a slow disaster. Despite their thorough search, the factory revealed nothing incriminating. Only tablet computers. The prospect of combing through data files seemed bleak; Gile had no real hope that they’d uncover a trace of the karmic protocol.

[SCENE: CH24_S03 | POV: Fiona | Location: SUV]

“This had to be a setup,” her partner muttered as they settled into the SUV.

“The lawyers did seem to show up pretty quickly,” Gile admitted. The weight of exhaustion pressed down on her as she leaned back, eyes closing for a moment before opening again with a sigh. “And not just any lawyers. Half of Silicon Valley’s top firms, plus specialists in corporate defense, antitrust, securities…” She trailed off, remembering the blur of business cards and firm names.

“Sato’s not just defending against us,” her partner said, his voice thoughtful. “Did you see the market alerts during the raid? Advent Industries started buying up shares in three of her subsidiary companies.” He pulled out his phone, scrolling through notifications. “The timing’s too perfect. While we’re searching for protocol hardware, someone’s trying to strip her of corporate assets.”

Gile’s mouth tightened. “We’re law enforcement, not corporate raiders. O’Hearn’s using our investigation as cover for a hostile takeover.”

“Above our pay grade,” her partner cut in, though his expression suggested he shared her unease. “But it explains why her defense was so… comprehensive. Those weren’t just protocol safeguards we saw today.”

“Cray won’t care,” Gile said, rubbing her temples. “He’s so focused on the protocol, he probably hasn’t noticed we’re playing into someone else’s game.”

Her partner’s response was interrupted by an alert on both their phones: “Georgia Sato Announces Emergency Board Meeting - Market Speculation Intensifies.”

 “All I know,” Gile said looking up from her phone, “is if Cray thinks he’s pinning this on us when most of the intel came from his new bestie, Frank O’Hearn, he’s got another thing coming. This is going to look horrible for everyone involved.”

=== CHAPTER 25 ===

[SCENE: CH25_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Hotel Room]

The news anchor’s voice resonated through the room. “A factory in the middle of livestreaming a tour for children receiving free computers from the tablets-for-tots program was mistakenly raided this week by Homeland Security,” she announced, holding up one of the colorful tablets.

Tim barely registered the heat wave of August 2027 that had reportedly added to the agents’ discomfort. It was the implications that caught his attention.

Tim’s gaze flicked to the screen as the anchor continued, “Here in studio with us today is Ms. Georgia Sato, a benefactor of the program and owner of the factory who happened to be present during the botched raid, and State Senator Steven Yost, who was accompanying the class from his district on the tour. Georgia, Senator, good morning.”

“Good morning,” they both replied. Tim noted the tension in Senator Yost’s stance as he leaned forward.

“Homeland Security has tried to paint this as an honest mistake, but you have a different take, don’t you, Senator?” the anchor pressed.

Tim leaned forward slightly.

“Yes, I do,” the Senator said. “This was apparently the third raid by Homeland Security over this karmic protocol. The fact that they had raided a property in my district, formerly owned and donated to meditation teachers by Ms. Sato, makes it extremely hard for me to believe this was anything but a targeted attempt to entrap or discredit her. We have here an incredibly successful businesswoman, daughter of immigrants to our country, practicing and supporting her spiritual beliefs, giving back through many programs like tablets-for-tots, and this is how she is treated?”

Tim’s eyes flickered to Georgia Sato, who, despite the strain in her smile, projected calm. She spoke with the ease of someone accustomed to public scrutiny. “The federal government and Homeland Security in particular are tasked with keeping us safe. I admire and applaud their hard-working agents who have neutralized so many credible threats over the years.”

Tim felt a subtle shift in the room as both the anchor and the Senator nodded. He glanced at Zach, who raised an eyebrow in acknowledgment of the underlying tension.

“However,” Georgia continued, her voice soft but steely, “my understanding, given what Senator Yost and his colleagues have been able to dig up since this last raid, is that several agencies of the federal administration seem to be colluding, targeting, and eradicating a particular program that aids in meditation. If it weren’t for the livestream happening that day, this, well, let’s call it what it is, manhunt, likely would have gone unnoticed and ended up doing real harm, damage to our trust in our government, instead of just scaring the bejeezus out of a group of darling children.”

Tim’s jaw tightened at the word “manhunt.” The implications were becoming clearer, and the stakes higher.

“Homeland Security will not release any facts about this operation, nor state what exactly the threat to national security is that they trying to stop,” the Senator added, his voice rising with each word.

Tim noted how the anchor shifted slightly, as if bracing for the transition. She nodded to the Senator and then faced the camera. “Well, we know the cease-and-desist and warrant were targeting a virtual reality program called the karmic protocol. What do we know about that? Senator Yost and Ms. Sato will be joined by Carly Rice from the retreat center that invented it here for the next segment. Don’t go anywhere!”

As the broadcast cut to commercial, Tim exchanged a look with Zach, a knowing smile passing between them. An extended exhale followed, broken only when Zach glanced down at his phone and muttered, “Bronski’s texting. He’s eager for our second meeting.”

Tim’s eyes flicked back to the screen as the program resumed, his mind already racing with possibilities.

“Welcome back. We’re discussing the recent Homeland Security raids with Senator Steven Yost, Georgia Sato, and Carly Rice from the retreat center that invented what’s being called the ‘karmic protocol.’ Ms. Rice, can you tell us exactly what this protocol is and why the government seems so intent on seizing it?” The host’s voice filled the room with practiced neutrality.

Tim watched Carly straighten in her chair. The flicker of hesitation in her eyes vanished, replaced by a calm resolve. “The protocol is a meditation aid that uses virtual reality and artificial intelligence to help people recognize the true nature of their own consciousness. It’s completely voluntary, non-invasive, and has been successful in every documented case of proper use.”

Tim’s focus sharpened as the host leaned in, sensing an opportunity. “Successful in what way?” she asked.

“In helping people achieve what Buddhist traditions would call enlightenment; what neuroscience might call a permanent shift in default consciousness,” Carly said. Her words were measured, carrying a quiet defiance. “The government’s response has been, frankly, overwrought. They’re treating a meditation tool like it’s some kind of weapon.”

Tim shifted in his seat, catching the slight tension in the Senator’s jaw as the host turned to him. “Senator Yost, did you have any knowledge of this technology being developed in your district?”

“None whatsoever,” Yost admitted. “My first introduction to the protocol was through news reports of these increasingly aggressive federal raids. What concerns me is the pattern of targeting Ms. Sato’s properties without clear probable cause.”

Tim’s eyes darted to Georgia Sato, who remained poised. “Ms. Sato, your company’s facility was the latest target. Were you manufacturing this protocol?” the host asked.

“The facility produces educational tablets for underprivileged children,” Georgia said smoothly, her voice betraying nothing. Tim knew her public statements were always well-practiced. “While I have supported the retreat center’s general mission through charitable donations, I have no direct knowledge of or involvement with the protocol’s development.”

Tim’s mind raced, piecing together what Georgia left unsaid. He remembered the meticulous shipments, the strategic partnerships that had been whispered about in tech circles. Georgia had been careful, deliberate. The factory’s operations, those shipments of electronic components and the labyrinthine paperwork, had been more than legitimate; they’d been a shield, a way to mask the true purpose behind the enterprise.

The children’s tablet program, he reflected, was both a noble cause and an impeccable cover. Everything from the bulk orders of display panels to specialized testing equipment made sense on paper. But beneath that surface, a second, concealed production line had been taking form. It was all done with such precision that even Tim marveled at the level of deception.

“Ms. Rice,” the host said, pulling Tim back to the present, “Homeland Security claims this is an unlicensed medical device that poses risks to users. How do you respond?”

“The protocol is not a medical device. It’s a tool for consciousness exploration, no different in principle from traditional meditation techniques. We’ve documented no adverse effects, and in fact, users report improved mental health, emotional regulation and life satisfaction,” Carly said, her tone unwavering.

Tim could sense the host’s skepticism before she voiced it. “Yet you kept its development secret?”

“We were careful and methodical in our testing, yes. But now that the government has forced this into the open, we’ll be formally challenging the cease-and-desist order. The protocol works. It’s safe. And people have a right to use it if they choose.”

“Even if it fundamentally alters their consciousness?” the host pressed.

“Especially then,” Carly replied with a slight smile. “We alter our consciousness every day through education, through meditation, through exercise, through prayer. The protocol simply makes that process more efficient. It’s like AI has made coding more efficient. The government’s reaction reveals more about their fears than any actual danger from the technology.”

The host leaned forward. “And if the cease-and-desist is lifted?”

“We have decided to cease all activities at our retreat center in the wake of this government intrusion,” Carly said simply, her voice carrying the weight of finality. “We hope there will be no more secrets, no more hiding. It’s time for transparency not only about what this technology can offer humanity, but why the government is apparently so opposed to it.”

Senator Yost’s nod seemed almost rehearsed, while Georgia’s face held its polished neutrality. But it was Carly’s composed confidence that captured Tim’s attention. She spoke like someone who knew which side of history she was on, and that knowledge, Tim realized, might be the most powerful tool she possessed.

=== CHAPTER 26 ===

[SCENE: CH26_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's Office]

In his office, Bud’s eyes remained glued to the livestream replay. He’d never seen an operation unfold quite like this, it looked clean, professional, by-the-book enforcement. But the sight of those kids’ faces gnawed at him, making his stomach clench. One girl in particular kept drawing his attention. She had been beaming as she showcased her new tablet, right up until the agents burst in. The way her expression crumpled haunted him. He hadn’t set this up, and didn’t think it was a particularly good idea, but he recognized his involvement nonetheless.

Bud paused the video, pressing his fingers to his tired eyes. The intel had been good, hadn’t it? The justification solid? But watching armed agents storm into what was a children’s tech education event felt excessive. Like using a sledgehammer to swat a fly. Worse, it felt like something Frank would have signed off on, not him. When had they veered from reasonable caution into paranoid overreach?

The buzz of his phone snapped him back. Probably O’Hearn, eager to strategize damage control. Bud ignored it, letting it vibrate against the desk. The little girl’s face lingered in his mind, an unwelcome echo reminding him of the type of enforcement he’d green-lit without hesitation. He had joined government relations to steer innovation, not to instill fear in children under the guise of protection.

With a weary sigh, Bud closed the video window. There were meetings to attend, statements to draft, narratives to control. Yet beneath the surface, something within him had shifted, a tiny crack in his once-unwavering certainty that refused to be ignored.

[SCENE: CH26_S02 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Virtual Boardroom]

“Absolutely not!” Lawrence Cray’s voice thundered through the virtual conference room. The holographic projection flickered with his intensity. Withdrawing the cease-and-desist would send exactly the wrong message. It would legitimize the protocol’s operation, undermine everything he had worked toward.

“The order won’t survive a First Amendment challenge,” another avatar spoke, radiating a calm that grated on Cray’s nerves. As if logic were a shield against reality, he thought. “Religious freedom trumps speculative consumer protection concerns.”

Cray’s jaw tightened as Gwen Trout broke in, her voice sharp, cutting through the room’s tension. “This isn’t about consumer protection. The neurological alterations we’re seeing in test subjects.”

“Are all technically beneficial by current medical standards,” one of the lawyers interjected, too quickly, Cray noted. Too neatly. “We can’t prove harm, and without proof of harm, were on shaky regulatory ground. The raid was based on an imminent threat that doesn’t appear to have materialized.”

Cray exhaled slowly, feeling the tightness in his chest. The argument looped endlessly, logic stacked against urgency. “What about compelling government interest in maintaining social stability? The Harbridge simulations clearly show.”

“Theoretical models won’t convince a judge,” Constance’s voice sliced through, cold and dismissive. Cray felt the frustration claw at him. She was right, damn her. “Not against actual data showing improved mental health outcomes.”

“So, we just give up?” The question escaped him before he could filter out the desperation. His pulse quickened, a thrum under his collar. “Let them spread this consciousness-altering technology without any oversight?”

Constance’s avatar barely moved, her expression neutral. “No one’s suggesting complete surrender. But we need to shift our approach. Focus on proper clinical trials, standardized safety protocols…”

Cray’s fingers clenched into fists beneath the table as another attorney chimed in, their voice too measured, too certain. “The 2026 Administrative Procedures Act amendments require sixty days of public comment for any major rule. Even under emergency authorization, we’re looking at Q2 2028 before permanent regulations take effect.”

Trout glanced at her calendar, brows drawing together. Cray noted the slight frown. “The WHO’s Global Regulatory Framework update is scheduled for their June 2028 assembly. We need something in place before then. Even so, it may be too late,” she added, her tone sinking. “The changes we’re seeing in neural architecture appear to be permanent.”

“The administration’s position is clear,” Constance said, her tone flattening as if the debate were already sealed. “We’re not going to die on this hill. Not with midterms coming up and religious advocates mobilizing on both sides of the issue.”

“Homeland Security claims this is an unlicensed medical device that poses risks to users. How do you respond?” the host had asked.

“The protocol is not a medical device, it’s a tool for consciousness exploration,” Carly had replied firmly. The sound bite played again in Cray’s mind as he faced Constance across the table.

“Politics,” Cray spat, the word tasting bitter, acidic. “While we debate classifications, O’Hearn’s using our investigation to position himself for a corporate takeover. The market moves today weren’t subtle.”

“Which is exactly why we need to tread carefully,” Constance countered, her voice sharp with warning. “O’Hearn’s corporate raid complicates everything. If we push too hard now, we risk looking like government enforcers doing a tech giant’s dirty work.”

“You think I care about O’Hearn’s corporate games?” Cray demanded, his frustration building. “The protocol…”

“The protocol is part of a bigger picture now,” Constance cut in. “Think, Lawrence. Every move we make against Sato’s operations gets painted as either government overreach or corporate manipulation. O’Hearn’s takeover bid has changed the optics completely.”

“So, we just give up?” The question escaped him before he could filter out the desperation. “Let them spread this consciousness-altering technology without any oversight?”

Constance’s avatar moved ever so slightly, her expression neutral but her voice carrying an edge of steel. “No one’s suggesting complete surrender. But we need to shift our approach. O’Hearn’s corporate assault means any direct action we take will look coordinated with his takeover attempt. The media’s already drawing connections between the raid timing and today’s market moves. We pick our battles. This isn’t one we can win through direct confrontation, not while O’Hearn’s corporate warfare makes every government action look suspicious.”

The meeting droned on, a mechanical extension of decisions already made in closed circles. By day’s end, Cray knew, the cease-and-desist would be lifted. The protocol could go live again, sanctioned and unstoppable.

Gwen Trout’s office was dark, illuminated only by the soft glow of her monitor. The brain scan data haunted her, vivid and unrelenting, neural pathways, permanently altered; consciousness, transformed in ways no study had yet explained. The sharp vibration of her phone broke the silence, a text from Cray: “Need to talk. Secure line.”

She picked up the secure line, fingers trembling slightly as she dialed.

“They’re going to announce the withdrawal tomorrow,” Cray’s voice cut through, tense and without preamble.

She closed her eyes briefly, letting the inevitability settle in. “I know. The attorney’s brief was convincing, at least on legal grounds.”

“We can’t let this go, Gwen, you and I are the only ones who seem to understand the gravity of the situation.” Cray’s insistence was familiar, that stubborn fire she both admired and dreaded.

Her eyes drifted back to the scans, data flickering like an accusation. “The FDA still has jurisdiction over neural interface devices. I’m drafting new testing protocols and safety requirements.”

“Regulations won’t be enough,” Cray interrupted, voice sharp, as if the idea had already burned through his patience. “They’ll find ways around them. They already are. We need a bigger strategy.”

She shifted her focus to the Federal Register deadlines on her screen, running through contingencies in her mind. “DEA scheduling could take effect immediately upon filing. If we push it through by the end of January 2028, enforcement could start before the new fiscal year funding.”

There was a pause, filled only by the hum of her monitor. Someone else nearby muttered about the OMB’s backlog. Election year complications.

Cray’s next words cut through the noise. “There’s a Reverend that has connections, people who understand the real stakes, who know how dangerous this protocol is, who aren’t limited by political concerns.”

Gwen stared at the neural data, each line a silent testament to irreversible change. “Send me the details. And Lawrence?” She paused, weighing the sharp edge of her next words. “Be careful. Just because we’re right doesn’t mean we can cross every line.”

“Sometimes protection requires prevention,” he replied, the familiar phrase grounding them both. “Even if people don’t understand what they’re being protected from.”

When the call ended, she was left with the rhythmic hum of her office and the steady glow of the monitor. With a deep breath, she began a new file: “Preliminary Safety Review: Neurological Impacts of Quantum Consciousness Modification.”

The supporters of the protocol had secured a victory today. But she and Cray had something stronger than momentum: the patient, relentless power of regulatory oversight. And they would wield it with precision.

[SCENE: CH26_S03 | POV: Constance | Location: Constance's Office]

Constance Henning walked into her office to find one of the FTC attorneys already there, seated with an air of calm that bordered on resignation. She slipped off her coat, draping it over the back of her chair, and met his eyes. “The announcement goes out at noon,” she said, her tone brisk. “How bad is the blowback likely to be?”

The attorney leaned forward, the light catching on his glasses. “From the retreat center? Minimal. They got what they wanted. From Cray and Trout…” He shrugged, a slight lift of his shoulders that spoke volumes. “They’ll keep fighting through other channels.”

Henning settled into her chair, the leather creaking slightly. The weight of the day pressed on her, but she kept her expression neutral. “They’re not wrong about the risks,” she said, voice measured. The reports had painted an unsettling picture, mass consciousness transformation, the kind that could upend the very fabric of society. “Destabilization isn’t just a possibility; it’s probable.”

“Inevitable.” the attorney said, a rare hint of agreement in his voice. “But consumer protection regulations and device licensing won’t stop it. That window’s closed.”

Henning’s gaze shifted to the framed citation on her wall. “So, we watch and wait?” she asked, her words steady, almost rhetorical.

“We watch and document,” the lawyer replied, his tone taking on a clinical edge. “This time, we build the case the right way, through proper channels.” He hesitated, the pause sharpening her focus.

“And?” she prompted.

“Keep an eye on Cray and Trout,” he said, the quiet warning settling between them like an unwelcome guest. “They’re true believers that this protocol is the end of society as we know it. Those are always the most dangerous.”

Henning nodded, the slow realization sinking in. Cray and Trout’s fervor could be an unpredictable force. “The protocol may be beyond our immediate control now,” she said, her voice low but firm. “But we can still control how we respond to it.”

“Exactly.” The lawyer’s mouth quirked in a fleeting smile. “Sometimes the best move is to step back and let things play out. Especially when you’re holding a weak hand.”

They spent the next hour with several staff and attorneys, outlining the plan, how to manage the announcement of the lifting of the cease and desist, handling press calls, brief key legislators. But as they worked, an unspoken understanding lingered. This was not an end, just a pause, a tactical retreat in a battle that was far from over. The protocol was loose in the world now, an entity beyond containment. All they could do was watch, wait, and brace for the fallout.

[SCENE: CH26_S04 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

Cray sat in his dimly lit office, the glow of the monitor casting harsh light across his face as he read Trout’s preliminary safety review. The withdrawal announcement had gone out as planned, wrapped in layers of carefully worded assurances about ongoing monitoring and future safety protocols. Political theater, he thought, a thin veil over the administration’s calculated inaction.

The buzz of his phone interrupted his focus. He glanced at the message from his Vatican security contact: “Meeting confirmed. Will send secure details.” A sense of resolve tightened his chest. Clara’s image flashed in his mind, as did the Harbridge simulations, , consciousness rewritten, society teetering on the brink.

The administration might gamble on religious freedom and political survival, willing to accept the risk of societal collapse. But Cray’s oath to protect and defend didn’t come with caveats. Sometimes that duty required stepping into the shadows, making the decisions that others shied away from. He accepted that long ago.

He began drafting a message to Trout, detailing the next phase of their plan. Let the protocol’s supporters bask in their victory; let them believe the fight was over. The victories that mattered most, Cray knew, were often those unseen.

Beyond the window, the city’s lights glimmered like watchful eyes as he worked late into the night. Strategy notes, points of pressure, a map of battles yet to come filled the space around him. The protocol might officially move forward, but in reality, its temporary reprieve was conditional. As long as he and Trout understood what was at stake, it was never beyond their reach. They would find a way to stop it.

His phone vibrated again. Another message from his Vatican contact: “Preliminary review of evidence concerning. Further discussion required.”

A grim smile played at the corner of Cray’s lips as he typed out his response, his chest tightening. Losing one battle meant little when the war was far from over. This war wasn’t fought for land or power but for the core of human consciousness itself.

The protocol’s supporters had passion, public favor, the backing of rhetoric. But Cray and Trout had something stronger: unwavering conviction, a silent, unstoppable force. They would wield every tool available, unseen and tireless, to protect humanity, even when humanity couldn’t see the danger or refused to accept the shield.

[SCENE: CH26_S05 | POV: Arahant | Location: Courtyard]

Outside, one of the newly enlightened from the center found himself seated on a low bench near the courtyard fountain. The cool water spilled in steady arcs, the rhythm as precise as breath, as natural as the rise and fall of the sun. He didn’t need to watch it to feel its flow. The pulse of the fountain and the distant hum of insects in the evening air moved through him, as seamless as the blood in his veins.

A memory surfaced, unbidden but welcome. Before the protocol, he had been an architect, his days consumed by blueprints and deadlines, his nights restless with the fear of failure. He had lived for symmetry, control, the satisfaction of things fitting neatly into their places. Awakening had revealed what he couldn’t see then: there was no neatness in the world, no perfect edges or straight lines. The beauty lay in its imperfections, in the way each piece held its place in the whole, whether he understood it or not.

The fountain’s rhythm shifted slightly, the wind catching the water mid-arc and scattering it into fine droplets. He smiled faintly, feeling the cool mist on his face. The government’s plans being formed tonight were as fleeting as those droplets. And yet, they mattered. Not because they would succeed or fail, but because they were the next step, the next note in a melody that had no end.

A shadow moved across the courtyard as someone passed by, their silhouette cast briefly against the stone wall. He felt their energy. He didn’t need to know who it was to understand them. Their drive was familiar, human.

He rose slowly, his movements unhurried, and turned toward the retreat’s garden path. The stones beneath his feet were cool, each one worn smooth by countless steps over countless days. He didn’t need to see the path ahead to trust it. The striving was simply the world, reaching toward itself.

The night deepened around him, the stars emerging one by one in the vast sky above. He paused for a moment, gazing upward. The stars didn’t compete for space or brilliance. They simply were, each one adding its light to the whole. As he continued down the path, the faint sounds of conversation drifted on the breeze, mingling with the rustle of leaves and the murmur of the fountain.

Awakening wasn’t about answers. It was about knowing there were none to seek. And yet, every step was worth taking, every voice worth hearing, every ripple worth feeling. He moved on, the harmony of the moment carrying him forward, whole and at peace.

=== CHAPTER 27 ===

[SCENE: CH27_S01 | POV: Georgia | Location: Reatreat House]

The room was dimly lit, just the way Georgia had planned. Heavy fabric draped over the windows blocked any view from outside, ensuring their privacy. The few low lamps scattered around the private retreat house cast enough light to create an intimate, almost conspiratorial atmosphere.

Georgia stood at the front, arms crossed, scanning the small gathering of individuals seated on leather chairs and meditation cushions. Each face was scrutinized, their presence was no accident. She had chosen them with care, people with the influence to help and the discretion to keep this gathering secret. They were already familiar with the the Karmic Protocol, and some had shown genuine interest.

“This is not a public unveiling,” she said, her voice steady and deliberate. Georgia resisted the urge to check her phone, knowing another barrage of urgent messages about O’Hearn’s latest market moves awaited her attention. “What we’re about to share with you cannot, under any circumstances, be discussed outside of this room. Time is no longer our luxury.”

Tim stood nearby. The air between them was thick with unspoken understanding. They both knew how pivotal this moment was - not just for the protocol, but for keeping it out of O’Hearn’s grasp.

“The Karmic Protocol has been fully developed. We’ve achieved what we set out to do, and more. Mass production has begun, using only our resources.” Georgia’s gaze swept over the select group. “This isn’t about seeking investors or public approval. This is about bringing the technology to the people, quietly, and quickly.”

A woman near the back, one whose eyes had been tracking the recent corporate warfare in the markets, raised her hand. “So why are we here?” Her voice carried the edge of someone accustomed to direct answers. “What’s our role in all of this?”

Georgia stepped forward before Tim could respond. “You’re here because we need trusted partners to help us distribute the Karmic Protocol on our terms. Quietly, carefully.” She met the woman’s gaze, letting her confidence anchor her words. “This isn’t about mass market appeal or tech conferences. We have full funding to operate under the radar, for now. What we need is a network, a discreet pathway to reach any who will benefit from this without drawing unwanted attention before certain corporate interests can gain control of our distribution channels.”

She stepped aside, her pulse quickening as Tim moved forward, the small black device cradled in his hands. He lifted the neural interface headset for all to see, and she noted the subtle shift in the room as their attention locked onto it.

“This,” Tim said, his voice cutting through the murmured anticipation, “is the key to something the world has never seen before. We’ve built a system to fundamentally change human consciousness, to accelerate enlightenment, break the chains of attachment, and reveal the true nature of reality.” Georgia’s gaze swept over the group, catching the brief flashes of recognition and understanding. These were the moments she thrived in, the realization in their eyes. They knew what this could mean.

Tim’s words carried on. “But we don’t need to explain what that means to you. You already understand the power behind this.”

The room buzzed with murmurs, and Georgia’s fingers twitched as she resisted the urge to interject. She needed them to process this. To see beyond their immediate questions.

She felt the shift in the room, the subtle nods, the spark of agreement catching fire. They were starting to understand.

The financier leaned forward, his expression a mixture of intrigue and concern. Georgia could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he spoke. “You’re asking us to distribute technology that can fundamentally alter human consciousness. Tech that may soon be outlawed if it isn’t already. More importantly, how do we ensure it won’t be commercialized or used for corporate gain? There’s a huge market for cognitive enhancement tech, companies may kill to get their hands on this.”

Georgia’s gaze flickered to Tim, noting the way his jaw tightened. She recognized the telltale sign of his simmering frustration. “That’s exactly what we’re avoiding,” he said, his voice clipped but controlled. “This isn’t a product to be sold to the highest bidder. We’ve built it to prevent misuse, quantum encryption, individualized neural patterns, quantum fail-safes that make it impossible to copy or mass-produce without our direct oversight. We don’t intend to let it be exploited by governments or tech giants.”

Georgia’s eyes shifted to a woman known for her deep connections in the tech world. The sharp glint in her eyes showed she was assessing more than just the words; she was probing for weaknesses. “But even if you don’t sell it, how long do you think you can keep this a secret?” she asked, leaning forward. “People already know the protocol exists, even if the government believes they’ve suppressed it, which I’m not entirely sure they do. Once units are seen in the open, once people truly realize you’ve cracked this code, the demand may be unstoppable. Companies and governments alike are pouring billions into AI-driven neural interfaces. How do you plan to keep them at bay?”

Georgia held her breath for a moment. She caught Tim’s eye, a silent acknowledgment passing between them before she turned back to the group. “That’s why we’re being extremely selective,” she said, each word deliberate.

She focused on the room, ensuring her voice carried not just authority but conviction. “We know the risks of AI commercialization. We’ve seen how quickly new technologies are commodified, twisted into something unrecognizable. This is different. The Karmic Protocol is about liberation, not control. But make no mistake, if we lose control of this, it could be used in ways we never intended. That’s why discretion is everything, particularly with this first production run.”

A heavy silence followed her words, and Georgia could feel the tension knotting in the room, winding tighter with every second. These were businesspeople accustomed to navigating cutting-edge technologies and the complex networks surrounding them, but the stakes here were higher than anything they had encountered before.

A voice from the back, a man seated near the window whose sharp eyes hadn’t missed a detail, pierced the silence. “Your stock lost twelve percent today,” he stated flatly. “Advent is positioned to gain three board seats by month’s end. The world’s already struggling to regulate AI systems that manipulate our behaviors online, and you’ve created something that goes even deeper. How do you distribute this technology when you might lose control of your own companies?”

Georgia’s attention snapped to him, recognizing the financier, whose hedge fund had quietly supported several of her ventures. His question cut to the heart of their accelerated timeline.

“That’s precisely why this meeting is happening now,” Tim interjected, his voice steady but urgent. “We’re also racing against corporate consolidation. Once these units are distributed, they can’t be recalled or controlled by anyone, including whoever might end up controlling our companies.”

The financier leaned forward, skepticism etched on his face. “You can’t fight market forces forever. Advent is offering a forty percent premium to shareholders. The pressure to sell will become overwhelming.”

Georgia didn’t flinch. “We’re not trying to fight market forces,” she said, her voice carrying quiet authority. “We’re ensuring this technology reaches the right hands before those forces can contain it. Each of you was chosen not just for your influence, but for your understanding of what’s at stake. When O’Hearn moves to seize control of our tech assets, he’ll find the most valuable one has already slipped through his fingers.”

“And if his lawyers freeze your assets before distribution?” the financier pressed. “They’ve already filed preliminary injunctions.”

A subtle smile crossed Georgia’s face. “Corporate assets can be frozen. But you can’t freeze awakening.” She gestured to Tim, who revealed the sleek black headset. “The first wave is ready. We have a narrow window, days, not weeks. That’s why we need partners who can act decisively, while the corporate world is focused on stock prices and board seats.”

Another voice changed the subject, seeming to relieve some of Tim’s tension. “The world’s already struggling to regulate AI systems that manipulate our behaviors online. You’ve created something that goes even deeper, something that can reshape consciousness itself. How do you avoid the same ethical pitfalls? How do you prevent this from becoming another tool for control, another way for corporations to hijack the human mind?”

Tim’s sigh broke through the tense quiet, but Georgia felt the weight of his response like a shared burden. “We’ve built the protocol with every possible safeguard,” he said, each word weighed with unspoken concerns. Georgia’s pulse quickened as he continued, “But we’re aware of the ethical complexities. We have done everything possible to protect it from the risks of misuse. That’s why we need to to do our best to keep it out of the mainstream, away from the corporate and government machines that would inevitably try to commercialize it or weaponize it.”

The financier, who had been quiet since his last question, shook his head slowly. Georgia could almost feel his doubt in the air between them. “You can’t fight demand. No matter what safeguards you have, once word gets out, people will want this, badly. And once the general public knows what it can do, the pressure to sell it will become overwhelming. Are you really prepared to go against the tide of not only the entire tech industry but our very system of capitalism?”

Without a flicker of doubt Georgia stepped forward. The room shifted slightly as she commanded their attention. “We’re not naive. We know the challenges. But this technology can elevate human consciousness, not trap it in the same systems of exploitation and control that govern the rest of the tech world and society.

The silence that followed was thick, punctuated only by the faint hum of the lamps. Georgia watched the financier, noting the subtle shift in his posture, the way the guarded skepticism in his eyes gave way to consideration. Finally, he nodded, the gesture slow but deliberate. “If you’re going to pull this off, you’ll need allies, people who can keep this hidden while navigating the undercurrents of corporate greed and regulatory pressure. Count me in.”

Tim’s shoulders eased, and Georgia felt a small surge of relief ripple through her. His voice was measured, but she sensed the unspoken agreement between them as he spoke. “We’re not trying to start a revolution,” he said. Georgia knew he was speaking for them both. “But we are trying to make sure that when the world finally catches on to what we’ve built, it’s ready for it, and that it can’t be turned against the very people it was designed to help.”

=== CHAPTER 28 ===

[SCENE: CH28_S01 | POV: Carly | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Carly couldn’t help but think how perfect the fall day was as she walked along one of the many trails winding through the woods at Jeta’s Grove. A cloudless sky allowed the sun to filter through the now-bare branches, warming her face in intermittent patches. The babbling of a brook somewhere nearby added a soothing background to the chorus of bird calls. Cool air invigorated her lungs as she took a deep breath.

The path ahead was swept clear of leaves, a meticulous touch that must have been done earlier that morning. High winds had rattled through the grove the night before, scattering foliage that now lay piled beyond the trail’s edge. Carly glanced back, noting the path behind was equally pristine.

As she approached a small clearing, her eyes caught on an old wooden bench nestled beneath a towering oak. It looked as if it had been there for years, possibly placed by the former owner of the land. She felt a sudden urge to sit, to let the peacefulness of the day sink in and soothe her restless mind.

Settling onto the bench, Carly gazed absently down the clear trail, realizing she must have been lost in her own thoughts for quite some time. She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply to center herself, the crispness of the air sharp and refreshing as it filled her lungs.

When she opened her eyes again, the gentle attempt at focus fell short as her thoughts trickled back, unbidden. A small, resigned smile tugged at her lips. She liked to think of her thoughts as uninvited guests she’d learned not to chase away too hastily. Experience taught her that forcing them out only made them linger longer.

There was no shortage of thoughts to entertain, either. Life had been a whirlwind since the protocol became public. Here, in the tranquility of Jeta’s Grove, was the first time she’d managed to catch her breath. Yet her mind, ever analytical, turned the events like a puzzle she could solve if only she examined it closely enough. Understanding what had happened, piecing it together logically felt like the key to knowing what to do next.

A familiar tension tightened her chest as memories surfaced. The day the agents arrived at the retreat center felt as vivid now as it had then. Anxiety stirred easily, summoned by the memory of their sudden presence. Her conversation with Agent Gile played back in her head, the words she’d spoken, and those she’d deliberately left unsaid. The drive with Ed and the agents to the Homeland Security office came back in startling clarity: the scenery blurring by the window, the sun cutting sharp angles into the car, the strained silence.

Carly focused on her breath as memories of Ed’s questioning resurfaced. The interview was formal, professional, and probing. Carly couldn’t shake the feeling that the agents were concealing how much they knew; the pointed, almost strategic nature of their questions hinted at an agenda. They delved into Ed’s background, his life before and after the protocol, life at the retreat center, and the reasons behind his decision to stay. The line of inquiry extended to what he had been doing in the time since. His responses were straightforward, unwaveringly honest, but Carly noticed how each answer seemed to irritate the agents, as if they were hoping for a revelation that would slot neatly into a narrative they had already constructed around the protocol. The frustration in their eyes was palpable.

A wave of sadness washed over her as she recalled the temporary closure of the retreat center, a decision that had been mutual once news of the cease-and-desist order and raid spread. She glanced around Jeta’s Grove, the trees and open spaces offering a momentary sense of peace. Gratitude swelled within her; at least this place could still shelter the full-time meditators. Some of them, she knew, had nowhere else to turn. Many had been preparing for the protocol, only for those plans to evaporate in the wake of uncertainty. Starting from scratch seemed impossible, especially without their notes or prototypes, despite the technical lifting of the cease-and-desist.

Her mind shifted to the memory of the botched raid at Georgia Sato’s tablet computer facility, a moment that brought an unexpected flicker of satisfaction. Carly felt a touch of guilt at the joy the thought sparked. She knew this feeling was unskillful, a reaction rooted in the simmering resentment she harbored over the unjust intrusion on their peaceful retreat center. The laugh that bubbled up caught her by surprise, unskillful as it was, but it felt oddly liberating. Shaking her head, she reflected on the series of interviews and statements she’d given afterward. Those had been composed, deliberate, and measured, though they still carried the bitter undertone of that fateful day at the retreat center.

Straightening herself, Carly stood from the little bench and resumed her walk. Gratitude welled up within her for Jeta’s Grove, for the way it had embraced her when the relentless stream of press and attorneys had finally begun to fade. She needed this pause, this peace. It was what she had always envisioned, not just for herself, but for the entire world. The retreat center, the protocol, it had all been for that purpose: to bring insight and wisdom to a world drowning in commercialism, fear and anger. So blinded by those forces, she thought, that when faced with the possibility of true understanding, the world’s best response had been to send agents to shut it down.

A small smile formed as she realized her thoughts had circled back to where they began. She focused her eyes a few feet ahead on the path and returned her attention to her breath, the cool air entering her nostrils, the warm air leaving her mouth. She felt each step press into the earth beneath her, the gentle breeze brushing against the back of her neck.

[SCENE: CH28_S02 | POV: Carly | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Suddenly, another pair of sandals came into view. She lifted her gaze and saw Ed approaching, hands clasped in front of him, moving steadily from the other direction.

Ed brought his hands together and offered Carly a small bow. She mirrored the gesture, feeling a fleeting twinge of envy at his glowing smile, his calm demeanor and the kindness radiating from his eyes.

The envy dissolved as quickly as it appeared. It was nearly impossible to hold on to anything other than joy in the presence of one of the awakened ones. The tension in her face eased, and the corners of her lips turned upward into a soft smile.

“Ed,” she said, acknowledging him.

“Carly,” he responded, stepping to the side. For a moment, she thought he was making way for her to pass, but as she moved forward, he turned slightly, signaling his intent to walk beside her.

“What thoughts today?” he asked, his voice calm and searching as he looked at her with a knowing expression.

“I just noticed the path has been cleared of leaves,” she replied, her tone light.

“Sweeping the path is a relaxing, meditative task,” Ed remarked, his eyes briefly drifting to the ground ahead.

“Allegorical as well,” Carly added, a hint of reflection in her voice.

“How so?” Ed asked, tilting his head slightly to catch her response.

“Oh, you know, keeping the path clear for those who follow,” Carly said, her voice trailing off as the thought settled into the space between them.

“Yes,” Ed replied, a knowing look crossing his face. “I believe I do know. You’ve done much the same over the years, keeping the center running.”

A wry smile tugged at her lips. “Well, that’s all over now,” she said, waving her hand as if sweeping away the remnants of the past.

“Perhaps.”

They walked in companionable silence, the sound of leaves rustling underfoot punctuating their thoughts. After a while, Carly paused and turned to face him. “Why did you decide to stay here and teach? Some of the others…” She hesitated, unsure how to frame her question without revealing too much of her doubt.

Ed seemed to sense her discomfort and interrupted gently, “To the path clear.”

The tension eased in her shoulders, and she met his eyes with a small, grateful smile. “I’m afraid I may have missed my chance at enlightenment,” she admitted, a note of regret threading through her voice. “Do you think we handled the protocol skillfully?”

Ed’s expression turned contemplative. “We were presented with an unprecedented situation. We were as mindful and kind as was possible under the circumstances. Despite the setbacks, the wheel has been set into motion, and even without the protocol, the path has been cleared.”

“Until the next storm,” Carly said, resuming their walk. The thought she had been turning over since the raid edged forward, seeking release. She stopped, glancing sideways at Ed. “When Homeland Security came here… I heard from Tim that the agents never saw you or the others. Is that true?”

Ed’s smile deepened, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “The agents saw what they were capable of seeing. Like the merchants of old who passed by the Buddha under his tree, seeing only another wandering ascetic.” His gaze followed a single leaf spiraling down from above, landing softly at their feet. “The protocol doesn’t grant powers or create miracles, Carly. It helps remove the veils that prevent us from seeing what has always been true.”

Carly nodded slowly, the idea settling into her thoughts. “Until our own veils are lifted, we see only what we expect to see,” she said, the realization warming her from the inside out. They continued walking, silence stretching between them, as the wind picked up and leaves scattered across the path once more.

When they reached the main house, Ed stopped and turned to her, taking her hands in his. “Carly,” he said, his voice carrying a quiet strength, “though neither hope nor regret will benefit us, these feelings are as natural as the winds. Keep your path clear, recognize suffering as suffering, and continue your practice. I teach because, even though it may appear that modern society is overcome with passion, clinging, and aversion, if you look closely, you’ll see the seed of enlightenment inside even those most shrouded in darkness and submerged in sorrow.”

A subtle shift moved through Carly as she glanced past Ed, noticing several people in the distance, busy with their daily routines. For the first time, she felt as though she could truly see them. Each one seemed to carry a seed, some glowing faintly, ready to sprout, others shadowed but still alive and waiting. She turned back to speak, but Ed had already moved on, walking toward the others with a calm, purposeful stride.

=== CHAPTER 29 ===

[SCENE: CH29_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Coffee Shop]

“Joe Bronski, as I live and breathe!” Bud called out, spotting Joe making his way down the street toward the coffee shop. The sight of his old friend brought a rare smile to his face.

“Mister Bud Turner, the legend,” Joe responded, weaving through the small gate into the outdoor seating area. Bud stood up, and they embraced briefly. He took in Joe’s tailored suit and confident stride, a reflection of his new role.

“You have that vice-presidential air about you. We should plan a celebration at Hull’s,” Bud said, referring to Joe’s recent leap into upper management. His voice carried the genuine warmth of a mentor proud of his protégé.

Joe’s grin widened, though he waved off the idea with a hint of playful humility. “Hull’s is your domain; I don’t have enough friends to fill even a corner table there, let alone the whole place,” he joked, though Bud noted the flicker of pride behind the self-deprecation. “Seriously though, thanks for the assist with the board.”

Bud settled back into his chair, chuckling. “In all honesty, I’ve never recommended someone who needed it less,” he said, the week-old fatigue of parental leave still clinging to his bones but failing to dull his sharpness. He was fully back in stride now.

Joe slid into the seat across from him and reached for the coffee Bud had preemptively ordered. “It’s not every day an executive position opens up. I’m glad you gave me that nudge to apply.”

“Speaking of which, any word from Zach?” Bud asked, keeping his tone neutral as he sipped his coffee.

“Nothing,” Joe said, gaze dropping to his cup. The hesitance, the averted eyes, it wasn’t lost on Bud. The lie tasted unconvincing even from across the table. “The charges were dropped, and no one’s heard from him. Not that I’m surprised. I doubt he’d be reaching out after what happened.”

“Yeah, bad business,” Bud murmured, shaking his head. He let his voice drop just enough for only Joe to hear. “Between me and you, Frank didn’t handle that situation well.”

Joe’s laugh was short, a little too abrupt, before he leaned forward, voice lowered. “Chairman O’Hearn’s made this protocol his personal obsession. Sometimes I wonder if we’re not just an arm of the administration.”

Bud’s expression didn’t shift, but inside, a pang of recognition hit. He’d seen the seeds of this long before. “They got you on any of those projects?” he asked, watching Joe’s reaction closely.

Joe’s response was instant, too smooth. “Nope. Just the usual. After the Goodman mess, it’s all hands on deck to push units. Frank really believes if the karmic protocol gets out there no one will wants our products anymore.”

Bud managed a dry chuckle, masking his suspicions. They both laughed, a shared echo of camaraderie, and then the conversation lightened. Joe brought up Bud’s new son, anecdotes about his move, TV shows, concerts. Bud found himself enjoying the moment more than he expected. His wife was right: he needed to spend more time around people like Joe, newly promoted, driven, uninterested in the political currents that twisted through their industry. The thought settled comfortably as Bud resolved to make these meetups more frequent.

Joe’s expression grew serious as he leaned in. “So, what are your thoughts about the protocol?”

Bud paused, the question catching him off guard. What were his thoughts? They weren’t the same as they had been when he first learned about it. He searched for the right words. “I’m intrigued,” he said at last. “Not as worried as I used to be. Of course, it may all be academic at this point, seeing as the last I heard, the administration destroyed all the prototypes and notes.”

Joe’s brows lifted in surprise. “Really? O’Hearn certainly doesn’t seem to believe that.”

Bud allowed himself to smile. “Facts rarely get in the way of a well-developed belief,” he said. Memories of the fallout from the Sato factory raid surfaced, leaving a bitter aftertaste. “After the embarrassment over that ridiculous raid, the administration must have realized the whole thing was more trouble than it was worth, whether or not they’ve truly stopped the protocol.”

Joe nodded, the glint in his eyes suggesting he was impressed by how much Bud knew.

“Once the cease-and-desist was tossed out with the Goodman charges, holding onto the tech became a liability,” Bud continued. “Frank, though, can’t allow himself to see it that way, not with the civil IP suit still looming. But that’ll be thrown out too, mark my words.”

“You’re convinced Goodman did nothing wrong?” Joe’s tone was probing but light.

“Nothing worth suing over,” Bud said, gesturing with open palms. “Certainly, nothing illegal. Why? Do you think otherwise?”

Joe laughed, a sharp, knowing sound. “Oh, he’s the company scapegoat. If toilet paper went missing from the supply closet, they’d say Zach Goodman took it. But no, I worked with him. He was solid. Honestly, from what I’ve heard about the protocol, I doubt we had anything that would have helped.”

“At least we finally solved why he was so anxious about the government banning a VR platform,” Bud said, his hand slapping the table lightly as he chuckled.

Joe’s laughter echoed the sentiment. “So, besides O’Hearn’s obsession, do you think this protocol business is behind us?”

“For now,” Bud replied, his voice thoughtful. He glanced past Joe to the busy street beyond. “But with any innovation, no matter how much the government, industry, or even religious powers try to bury it, it finds a way to resurface. We may not have seen the end of the Karmic Protocol. Or if we have, we’ll see something else, perhaps not in this exact form, maybe not rooted in Buddhist concepts, but there’s been enough attention on this. Amateurs will tinker with similar ideas for years.”

“Why does the electric car come to mind?” Joe said, laughed.

Bud smirked and raised his eyebrows theatrically. “And we’re still successfully suppressing cold fusion for the energy companies,” he said, draining the last of his coffee.

Joe leaned back, his chair creaking as he relaxed. “This was nice, Bud. Good to see you back, refreshed, and a dad!”

“Agreed,” Bud said, pushing back his chair and standing up. “Let me know if you hear anything else. I’ll do the same, though I’m sure you’ll be so busy moving units that gossip won’t be on your radar.”

“True, but it’s fun to spread when I come across some,” Joe replied, grinning. “Say hi to Cindy and George for me.”

[SCENE: CH29_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Street]

As Bud made his way back to the office, a pang of disappointment settled over him. The protocol hadn’t turned into the issue for him he once feared it would become. His mind flickered to Constance and how she had insisted on the prototypes’ destruction, citing rumors of potential weaponization. The idea was almost laughable, he couldn’t imagine how it would work, but he trusted her judgment. He sighed, resigning himself. On to the next crisis, he thought, as he walked along.

=== CHAPTER 30 ===

[SCENE: CH30_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Warehouse]

The units were fortified with the best encryption available, outfitted with clear, user-friendly instructions, and boasted a sleek, minimalist design. The intricate layers of security showed his meticulous planning, redundant and complex enough to ensure that any tampering attempt would trigger the device to brick itself, erasing all data and frying its circuits in an instant.

Zach thought back to the two relentless weeks of testing that had led to this moment. He had overseen quality control at every step, from the precise etching of silicon wafers to the meticulous final assembly. Tim had pushed for a faster rollout, eager to see results, eager to outwit the lawyers, the government.

They had started cautiously producing just one unit on the first day, then five the next, rigorously testing each one offline. By the week’s end, their process had been refined enough to produce ten flawless units a day. By the second week, production had scaled up to twenty units daily without sacrificing quality.

The true challenge, Zach knew, wasn’t the production itself but maintaining the shroud of secrecy amidst so many moving parts. Components were sourced from different suppliers, the assembly process was split across multiple locations, and the completed units were promptly transferred to secure storage. Only a select few had full knowledge of the operation, ensuring each step remained compartmentalized and protected.

The dharmapalas had been a constant presence at the facility. Their vigilance kept any unnecessary attention at bay after their decoy operation at the tablet factory had succeeded beyond expectations. They worked tirelessly, subsisting on takeout meals, meditating when they could, and tracking media coverage. For Zach, the intensity of the work was invigorating. For the first time in what felt like ages, he had a clear purpose and a carefully crafted plan. He silently thanked Tim for involving him in this project.

His gratitude extended to the lawyer Tim had secured for him with Georgia Sato’s assistance. The criminal charges against him had finally been dropped, and the weight of that relief still resonated in his chest. It hadn’t surprised him when his attorney unearthed the fabricated evidence and noted the conveniently missing physical proof. It had all been a setup, and Zach knew exactly who had orchestrated it.

Zach scanned the financial news headlines with grim satisfaction as more units disappeared into nondescript packages, “Advent Industries Completes Acquisition of Sato Tech Assets,” “Corporate Raiders Find Empty Shell: Sato Operations Show No Irregular Activity.” “Market Analysts Puzzle Over Advent’s ‘Strategic Acquisition’ of Seemingly Routine Electronics Facilities”

A deep surge of pride washed over him as he watched the next wave of units being prepared for distribution. O’Hearn had won his corporate battle, seizing control of Georgia’s tech companies. Unfortunately, he found only ordinary electronics manufacturing. Meanwhile, the real prize was already spreading beyond his reach, carried by an invisible network of believers.

[SCENE: CH30_S02 | POV: Zach | Location: Warehouse]

“They’re still searching the old facility,” Tim said, walking up with his tablet displaying security feeds. “Third sweep this week. O’Hearn’s people are going crazy trying to figure out where the production materials he was convinced existed went.” He smiled slightly. “The district manager I left behind is getting quite irritated with all the corporate auditors disrupting his legitimate electronics business.”

Zach nodded, remembering their last night at the facility. “How’s the shareholder transition going?”

“Georgia’s playing her part perfectly,” Tim replied. “Appearing appropriately defeated in board meetings, gracefully accepting O’Hearn’s ‘strategic vision’ for her companies. Meanwhile…” he gestured to the busy room around them, where people continued the real work of their mission.

A new alert caught Zach’s eye, “Advent Industries Stock Drops as Acquisition Reveals No Significant IP Assets.”

“They thought they were buying the protocol,” Zach mused, watching another set of units undergo final testing. “Instead, they got a perfectly ordinary electronics company with surprisingly well-documented accounting.”

“Georgia’s final gift to them,” Tim said with a hint of satisfaction. “Everything legitimate, everything ordinary, everything exactly where it should be. Just not what they were looking for.”

The room hummed with focused energy as they continued their work. Each unit verified represented another small victory - not just over corporate control, but over the very idea that consciousness could be owned, regulated, or contained.

Zach’s shoulders slumped as he gazed at the operation, his ragged breaths slowly. While O’Hearn’s corporate machine churned through paperwork and property transfers, the real transformation was already beginning, spreading person to person, beyond the reach of shareholders or regulators.

But that was secondary now. The civil lawsuit continued to drag on, an ordeal that could stretch for months. Without the key evidence, however, it felt like only a matter of time before that case, too, would be dismissed.

Zach was keenly aware that he was still unemployed, but the sheer magnitude of the current mission left little room for concern. This was real work, meaningful work, manufacturing and distributing the karmic protocol. It consumed every spare moment, and he felt a flicker of satisfaction in that.

[SCENE: CH30_S03 | POV: Zach | Location: Warehouse]

The sound of Finn’s laughter floated over as they prepped the units for shipment. Curious, Zach moved closer, catching snippets of their conversation.

“Every member of Congress and world leader should get one,” Finn declared, his voice full of conviction.

He let out a chuckle, adjusting a stack of boxed units as he continued. “The priority is to get them into the hands of people likely to use them, but I like your thinking!”

Zach stepped in, his voice cutting through the banter. “Remember, many of those types, if they’ve heard about it at all, still see the protocol as a threat.”

Finn turned at the sound of his voice, his surprise giving way to acknowledgment.

“They’ll hear about it soon enough!” He responded, sealing a package with a firm slap of the label.

Tim grinned, eyes bright. “Yeah, they can only run so long from the inevitability of enlightenment.”

Zach nodded, but the weight of experience tempered his expression. “I don’t disagree,” he said, his tone measured. “But as we’ve seen firsthand, there are going to be growing pains along the way. Let’s try to ease them, not make them worse, if we can.”

Finn raised an eyebrow, a spark of defiance playing across his face. “Sometimes it’s easier just to rip the band-aid off,” he quipped, earning a knowing glance from Tim.

Zach’s mouth curved into a half-smile. “You usually wait for the bleeding to stop before you do that, Finn,” he said, a trace of humor softening his words as he looked between them.

After three months of meticulous production and strategic stockpiling, they were finally ready. Zach felt a pulse of anticipation as he took in the scene, the organized chaos of the facility buzzing with purpose. The first couple thousand protocols would soon be distributed across multiple locations around the world simultaneously, ensuring that containment would be impossible.

Tim stood nearby, studying the shipping manifests in his hands. Over a thousand units were prepared for deployment. Zach noted the way Tim’s fingers brushed over one of the sleek black headsets, a rare softness crossing his usually composed face.

“It took longer than we wanted,” Tim murmured, his voice thoughtful, “but the wait was worth it.” He paused, almost to himself, before added, “Sometimes the dharma moves slowly, but it moves with purpose. Arguing over a distribution list we’ve already finalized won’t make them ship any faster. Those who seek these out will find them, once we’ve gotten them out to the retreat centers, monasteries and other likely places.”

Zach observed Tim closely, a familiar curiosity stirring within him. Over time, he’d grown to respect and trust Tim’s judgment and enjoyed their late-night talks that always veered into philosophy and strategy. Yet, despite their shared history, from their time at the retreat center to working side by side in this facility, Tim remained an enigma. Zach knew the man was educated, that much was clear, but the details of his background, his upbringing, any family he might have had, all remained a mystery.

Still, he knew some things: Tim’s favorite pizza topping, his preference for sparkling water over flat, and the fact that he was an ardent student of Buddhist scriptures, far more committed than Zach himself, who had once considered his own dedication profound. Most importantly, he knew Tim was unwavering in his advocacy for spreading the protocol, driven and focused in a way that inspired those around him.

“Looks like the dismantling of the facility is proceeding smoothly,” Zach said, breaking the silence.

Tim glanced up, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly. “Yes,” he replied. “We’ll be ready to go mobile in a few days. This place can go back to fabricating solar panels or whatever they were doing here before we arrived.”

A voice from behind them interrupted, carrying a hint of sarcasm. “A shame,” Finn said, with a playful grin. “It was just starting to feel like home.”

“It’s definitely starting to smell like your home,” Tim quipped, setting a stack of boxes onto a hand truck. The joke landed perfectly, drawing a round of laughter from the group.

As the sound faded, Tim’s expression turned serious again. “We’ll need to lie low while this first wave hits,” he said. “After that, there’ll be other homes, I’m sure.”

A shadow crossed Zach’s face at those words. His shoulders tensed, almost imperceptibly, as he glanced toward the window.. Lying low—what would that even mean for him? He had already decided against joining the others at Jeta’s Grove, where some of them planned to regroup. The idea of being surrounded by familiar faces but feeling out of place didn’t appeal to him. And as for Tim and his inner circle, their next destination remained a mystery to Zach. He hadn’t been invited, and he wouldn’t ask.

The absence of a job, a role, weighed on him. He hadn’t signed up with any of the dharmapalas who would be monitoring the rollout and offering support to new users. Even if he had wanted to, he knew he was too recognizable for such assignments. His presence would draw attention, and that was the last thing they needed.

Zach had once floated the idea of embracing his visibility, maybe even doing some press to shape the narrative, but the group’s response had been clear. It wasn’t the right time, and Tim’s voice had been the most adamant, the edge of paranoia sharp in his tone. The risk was too great, he argued, and losing their main programmer to an ill-timed rendition attempt wasn’t a chance they could take.

Despite that, Zach didn’t feel particularly endangered anymore. The administration’s fervor had waned after their spectacular failure at the tablet factory, a blow from which they hadn’t recovered. The cease-and-desist order had been lifted, not that it mattered much now with the retreat center shuttered indefinitely.

He toyed with the idea of stepping back completely, observing the aftermath from a quiet place. He might stay, ready to step in if production continued or an unforeseen need arose. That thought carried a certain peaceful allure, time alone to think, to reconnect. Maybe he’d even reach out to Joe Bronski, catch up over stories they’d left unfinished.

[SCENE: CH30_S04 | POV: Zach | Location: Second Warehouse]

A few days later, Zach led Joe into what looked like an abandoned maker space. Dust coated old 3D printers and electronic components that sat forgotten on metal shelves, relics of past projects. But one corner had been meticulously cleared and equipped with modern, high-end gear. Zach’s eyes moved to the stripped-down neural interface headset connected to an array of monitors, a sense of anticipation tightening in his chest.

“Secondary location?” Joe asked, his tone giving away a rare note of awe.

Zach allowed himself a slight smile. “One of several,” he said, flipping a switch to power up the system. The hum of machinery filled the room, familiar and reassuring. “What I’m about to show you goes far beyond the architecture diagrams you’ve seen. We’re not just talking about a new kind of neural network here, we’re interfacing directly with quantum consciousness.”

His chest puffed out a bit as he began walking Joe through the protocol’s core systems. For the next hour, Zach explained each element meticulously: the quantum coherence detector, the neural interface layer, and the consciousness integration engine. The excitement in his voice grew as he described how they’d built on Penrose’s theories of quantum consciousness, turning theoretical possibilities into practical reality. He outlined their solution to the coherence problem through biological feedback loops and how they’d incorporated traditional meditation maps into the quantum attention fields.

“The hardware creates multiple feedback loops,” Zach said, his finger tracing the edge of the retinal tracking system. “This isn’t just monitoring eye movement, it’s detecting quantum coherence states in the visual cortex. The system picks up on micro-saccadic eye movements and pupillary responses, all while tracking neural oscillation patterns. It forms a feedback loop that keeps users locked into brainwave states associated with deep meditation. The EEG data feeds into the biological feedback network, sustaining the quantum attention field.”

A light of understanding flickered in Joe’s eyes. “That’s why you needed custom silicon,” he said, nodding slowly. “Standard neural processors couldn’t manage quantum coherence detection.”

“Exactly,” Zach replied, feeling a rush of validation. Joe was grasping the core of it now. “But that’s where O’Hearn is wrong. You couldn’t steal this technology, even if you tried. The hardware is just the interface. The real breakthrough was understanding that consciousness itself operates on quantum principles. We’ve simply created a way to make those principles accessible for direct experience.”

Zach’s gaze lingered on the monitors, the quiet hum of the room resonating with his heartbeat.

Zach moved confidently as he guided Joe through the various elements of the system: the insight state generators, the coherence validation systems, and the safety protocols designed to ensure that only those truly prepared could access the deeper states.

He could see Joe’s eyes widen slightly as he explained, “The headset’s neural interface uses non-invasive electroencephalography combined with precise temporal and spatial resolution. It doesn’t try to force consciousness into new states; instead, it provides real-time biofeedback that helps users recognize and sustain specific neural patterns. It’s like a mirror reflecting your own brain activity. The system constantly checks if you’re mentally ready for the deeper meditative states it facilitates. If you’re not, it eases you back, ensuring a gentle, safe experience, like a ride that slows down to let you adjust, preventing anyone from becoming overwhelmed.”

As Zach spoke, he could feel an unfamiliar steadiness within himself. This wasn’t just technical mastery; it was a conviction that resonated deeper than before. Joe noticed it too, the subtle recognition in his friend’s expression.

“The protocol won’t work if the user isn’t ready,” Zach continued, his voice steady and certain. “This isn’t about psychological screening alone. The quantum coherence measurements provide an objective gauge of readiness. We’re not manipulating quantum effects directly, that’s beyond current technology. What we’re doing is using quantum sensors to detect naturally occurring coherence in neural networks and providing biofeedback that helps users maintain those states. It’s less about creating new quantum waves and more about surfing the ones that already exist in the brain.”

Joe took a moment to process, nodding as the significance sank in. “This is leagues ahead of anything in the industry,” he said. “When Bud approached me with your questions about regulations…”

Zach interrupted, a slight, almost wistful smile on his face. “That feels like a lifetime ago,” he admitted. He remembered those days vividly, the sleepless nights, the gnawing anxiety about how to control access and prevent misuse. But now, the worries had shifted. “I was so focused on regulating access back then, making sure it couldn’t be misused. But now I see it differently. The protocol isn’t just another piece of technology to monitor or restrict. It’s like discovering that everyone has eyes capable of seeing the truth directly. We just built the tool to help them open those eyes.”

Zach’s gaze dropped to the neural headset, a quiet certainty anchoring him as he contemplated the journey that had brought them here.

“That’s not how O’Hearn and his friends at Homeland Security will see it,” Joe said, the concern evident in his eyes.

“No,” Zach agreed as he powered down the systems. “But that’s their karma to work out.” He reached into his bag and pulled out a small, carefully wrapped package. The anticipation in the room seemed to thrum as he handed it to Joe. “If you’re interested in seeing how the coherence detection really works…”

Joe’s eyes widened. “Zach, I…”

“Just hold on to it,” Zach interrupted, rising from his chair. He met Joe’s gaze with a look of calm determination. “The protocol finds its way to people when they’re ready.” He paused, the memory of past warnings and tense conversations surfacing briefly. “Oh, and Joe? Thanks for the heads-up about Bud back then. Knowing they were looking for reasons to ban the technology, it made me realize what we were really up against.”

Zach felt a strange mix of relief and finality as he handed Joe the package, watching the shift in Joe’s expression as he processed what it meant. The room was silent, the hum of the equipment still echoing softly in the background. Zach studied Joe’s reaction closely, how his friend’s eyes lingered on the package, the subtle tightening of his jaw, the way his fingers curled around the object as if it held the answer to a question he’d long avoided asking.

Joe glanced at his phone, the glow of missed calls from Bud catching Zach’s attention. Zach’s brow furrowed slightly as he imagined the conversation Joe might have, the careful, measured words, the cautious way Bud might react to what they were on the brink of unveiling.

“Some things,” Zach said, breaking the silence, “can’t be explained. They have to be experienced.” He noted the way Joe’s grip on the package tightened and continued, “It’s not about understanding with the mind alone. It’s about shifting your whole perspective.”

Joe nodded slowly, eyes still fixed on the package. Zach could see the gears turning, the internal debate playing out behind his friend’s expression. Zach felt a strange empathy then, having himself had to make the decision, whether to stay on the sidelines of knowledge or step directly into it.

As the moments stretched on, Zach’s mind drifted to quantum superposition, the concept that had fueled so many of their long nights. How particles could exist in multiple states until they were observed. He wondered if consciousness really did mirror that reality, if awareness itself shifted like those quantum particles, waiting for the observer to realize its many layers.

“The protocol,” Zach said, more to himself than to Joe, “isn’t about imposing a state. It’s about creating the conditions where consciousness can see its own nature. That’s why neural networks could never replicate this. It’s too bound to direct experience.”

Joe looked up, and for the first time in a while, their eyes met, both carrying the quiet realization that understanding technology was only the beginning. Zach could see it, Joe’s hesitation melting into a more resolve.

The hum of equipment powered down, leaving only the occasional click from cooling metal. Zach’s hands stilled on the workbench, his breathing slowing to match the rhythm of the dust motes drifting through the afternoon light. Across the table, Joe’s gaze lingered on the half-assembled prototype, neither of them reaching to continue their work.

The space between them filled with something tangible yet invisible. Zach’s lips parted, then closed without speaking. Joe nodded slightly, as if answering an unasked question. Their fingers brushed against the same component, then retreated.

Zach closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, he was looking inward, past the cluttered workbenches and calibrated tools, beyond the maker space walls. His hand moved to his chest, resting there, feeling his heartbeat as if mapping an unexplored territory.

Joe gathered their coat without breaking the silence, leaving footprints in the sawdust that gradually settled back into stillness after the door closed.

=== CHAPTER 31 ===

[SCENE: CH31_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

“Oh, and there’s a package for you,” Cheryl said, almost as an afterthought. Bud’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t expected anything. Arriving home early from work, he had been content to spend a rare hour with George, whose constant shifting between smiles and tears was a reminder of how fast he was growing. Bud’s chest tightened with affection at the thought of his son.

He walked to the front foyer and spotted the package: a plain, unmarked box. Picking it up, he felt the weight in his hands, then turned back to Cheryl in the living room. “Did it come by courier or something? There’s no label,” he said, a note of suspicion creeping into his voice.

“A nice gentleman dropped it off. I think he hoped to catch you at home,” she replied, her casual tone sharpening Bud’s senses.

“Did this nice gentleman have a name?” he asked, a sudden tightness in his chest.

“Tim Melenie or something like that, I think,” Cheryl said. Bud’s face went cold. The name echoed in his mind, erasing any doubt. Without another word, he bypassed the living room and went straight to his basement office, his pulse quickening.

[SCENE: CH31_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

Once seated at his desk, he opened the box. Two notes lie inside: one in a small envelope, and another simply folded, bearing the word Awaken. The weight of the word gnawed at him. He slipped the envelope open, the paper trembling slightly in his hands as he read, “Dearest Bud, I wanted you to have one of the first. Thanks again for inviting me to speak at the conference, and I sincerely hope you consider using this gift… perhaps after you’ve raised your son to be as kind of a man as you have turned out to be. Yours in gratitude, Timothy Mulvaney.”

The note fell from his fingers, landing silently on the floor. Mulvaney. Bud’s mind raced. His breath caught in his throat. How had Mulvaney known he had a son?

Bud snatched up his phone, pulling up the security footage from that morning. His stomach sank as the screen showed Tim Mulvaney, casual and smiling, walking up to the front door at precisely ten a.m. Bud’s eyes narrowed at the grainy image.

He switched to the garage camera, tracking Mulvaney’s exit back to a nondescript van parked across the street. He squinted at the screen, cursing the angle that kept the license plate hidden.

His gaze drifted to the headset inside the box. It was sleek and black, the initials KP etched in an even darker shade along the side. He ran his thumb over the engraving, a shiver traveling up his spine.

He unfolded the instruction sheet. Sparse and vague, it offered no real warnings, only cryptic language. Bud’s brows knitted together. Was this how they intended to spread it? A mass enlightenment through unmarked, enigmatic devices?

[SCENE: CH31_S03 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

“Call Constance Henning,” Bud said, his voice taut as he turned to the video screen. He sank into his chair, the weight of the revelation pressing down on him. So, the headsets were in production after all. Questions buzzed in his mind: How many had they made? Where were they going? Was there still anyone in the administration with enough resolve to stop this?

The screen flickered, and Constance’s face appeared, sharp and poised. “Bud,” she greeted him, her tone guarded. “Hello. I take it this isn’t a social call.”

“No, Commissioner, it most certainly is not,” Bud replied, rubbing a hand across his face. “And I wish I could blame my paranoia on a lack of sleep.”

“Bud Turner,” Constance said, a hint of dry amusement softening her voice, “what in the world do you have to be paranoid about?”

“It’s Mulvaney,” he said, pausing as the knot in his stomach tightened. “And probably Goodman. Maybe even Sato, for all I know.”

Her expression shifted, brows knitting as she exhaled sharply. “The protocol,” she muttered. “I knew we weren’t done with that, despite our best efforts.”

“They’ve gone and done it,” Bud said, his voice low and bitter. “I’m almost certain they’ve mass-produced it.”

Constance’s eyes narrowed. “What makes you say that?”

“Tim Mulvaney personally delivered one to my house this morning,” Bud said, his voice tight. He braced for the silence that followed. “It’s not some prototype, either. It has a logo etched on it, a sleek design, and even comes with printed instructions.”

A longer pause settled between them. Bud could almost hear the gears turning in Constance’s mind.

“That changes things,” she said finally. “Do you have plans for studying it, or using it, or would you bring it in?”

Plans? The thought hadn’t crystallized in his mind yet. Destroying it would be useless if more were out there, landing on doorsteps just like his. He clenched his jaw. “My company has no interest in it; besides, I don’t need my techs getting any ideas. I’ll bring it in.”

It was the right call. It’s possible the administration could discover the headsets’ creation process and location. Bud’s thoughts churned, grappling with the implications until Constance’s voice cut through.

“Good. I’m afraid Cray and his goon squad are going to have a field day when this breaks. Have you told anyone else?” she asked, her tone sharp.

Bud exhaled slowly. “I called you as soon as I looked it over and read the personal note Mulvaney delivered with it.”

“Hence your paranoia,” she said, a hint of irony in her voice. “Anything bad, useful, or threatening in the note?”

“No to all of those,” Bud said, his voice steady but weary. “Just a friendly note thanking me for inviting him to speak at the conference.” He hesitated for a moment. “Any idea how Cray is going to react?”

“Not calmly,” Constance said, her voice flattening. “He’ll be scrambling to save face, and… I’m not supposed to know this, but…”

The pause was unbearable, tension pulling at Bud’s chest. “Constance, what do you know that you’re not supposed to?” he pressed, trying to keep his voice even.

“Apparently, Cray has been working with the FDA,” she continued, each word careful, as if weighing their weight aloud. Bud’s pulse quickened. He could feel the pause lengthen. “And I don’t know, maybe Public Health and some of the others. O’Hearn’s been sniffing around too.”

Bud clenched his jaw. “Yeah, I created a monster there,” he muttered. Memories of the deceit Cray had condoned, at O’Hearn’s prodding, surfaced, the betrayal that fractured their task force and fueled Henning’s drastic actions.

“When can you be here?” Constance asked, cutting through the silence with urgency.

Bud glanced at the clock on his desk. “I can come by tonight. How late will you be in?”

“Oh, I’ll be here,” she said, a trace of fatigue softening her voice. She added with a resigned sigh, “Who knows, perhaps spreading this karmic protocol far and wide won’t be the end of the world. Even enlightened people need to eat and work, right?”

The attempt at optimism didn’t slip past him. He managed to have a dry smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Right,” he said softly.

=== CHAPTER 32 ===

[SCENE: CH32_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's House]

Zach set the video game controller on the table and leaned back into the worn embrace of his couch. He had been determined to beat this level without adjusting the difficulty setting, but tonight wasn’t going to be the night.

He considered switching on the news but quickly dismissed the idea. The thought of the karmic protocol’s grand rollout resurfaced, and with it, the gnawing ache of wondering just how disastrous it had been. How many people had used the devices? He had no way of knowing.

Zach shifted on the couch, reminding himself of the plan: stay under the radar, refuse all interview requests, and, most importantly, maintain complete silence on his phone, email, social media, anything that could be traced. The isolation left a bitter taste of loneliness and a creeping sense of helplessness he couldn’t shake, but he reminded himself it was necessary.

Someone would contact him when it was time for the next phase. Until then, he needed to remain invisible, avoid drawing any attention. The days blurred together floating between video games, and increasingly futile attempts at meditation. His mind refused to settle, thoughts slamming into one another with an urgency he couldn’t suppress. He sipped from a glass of water, then lay flat on the couch, rubbing his tired eyes.

It struck him how long it had been since he’d last taken a call, replied to an email, or sent a text. Not since… ever, really. The disconnect gnawed at him; he was desperate to know how the others were holding up. And yet, there was an odd relief in the silence. Without the constant barrage of notifications, he noticed the neglected pile of dishes, the laundry spilling out of the basket, the unopened bills. Frustrating, yes, but it brought an unexpected sense of clarity.

He exhaled slowly. The likelihood of finding work in tech again was laughably slim, he knew that. Maybe he’d end up behind the counter at a local comic book or video game store.

Zach’s mind drifted to the moment of his rapid initiation into the dharmapalas, their solemn vow echoing in his ears. “I vow to delay personal enlightenment until those who have not attained it, attain it,” he silently repeated. The words, spoken in the privacy of his thoughts, carried the weight of the commitment he had made.

In practice, this meant agreeing not to use the protocol until it could be safeguarded as an option for those prepared for enlightenment. He knew well that, much like the metaphorical vehicles of traditional Buddhist teachings, the protocol was discarded once it had fulfilled its purpose. Not all users who reached enlightenment felt compelled to teach meditation, and none had chosen to replicate or distribute the headsets. The dharmapalas, he realized with a tightening in his chest, would be essential for the foreseeable future.

Unless, of course, production resumed. The idea loomed in his mind, a labyrinth of potential risks, obstacles and delicate negotiations. Still, they had managed to awaken people once before. It wasn’t impossible. Improbable, definitely, but he could work with improbable.

Zach’s gaze unfocused as memories of those final days before the shipments surfaced. The dharmapalas had been offered one last chance to revoke their vow and use the protocol themselves, a fair gesture considering their mission and the difficulties that lay ahead. Yet not a single member had taken it. Zach hadn’t even hesitated in his refusal back then.

Now, though, the thought lingered. Doubt crept through him, subtle and insidious, and he allowed himself to feel it. After all, he had nothing but time. Even if hundreds or thousands found awakening through their work, could society truly adapt to the reality of a karmic protocol? The question gnawed at him. Was he destined to spend his life playing a relentless game of whack-a-mole with governments and institutions, forever on the run as the elusive target?

He also considered the possibility of losing. What if every headset was seized and destroyed? The thought left him with a hollow feeling in his chest. Where would that leave him? Unenlightened, for one. Perpetually monitored, or worse, marked as one of the few who had helped code the protocol but never used it.

Zach swung his legs off the couch and sat up, flicking on the television. The news, he figured, couldn’t be worse than spiraling deeper into his own well of fear, uncertainty, and creeping self-pity.

The screen lit up with a report about upcoming congressional inquiry hearings on the protocol. A dry laugh escaped him at the thought of an “invitation” landing in his inbox. From what he could piece together, the hearings would be heavily skewed, more spectacle than substance. He doubted anyone from their side would have a seat at the table. The administration wasn’t about to risk putting him, Carly Rice, or God forbid, Georgia Sato in front of the cameras. The last thing they wanted was to give any of them more airtime.

His mind shifted to the awakened. Would any of them be asked to testify? Unlikely, he decided. In his experience, the kind of people invited to testify were already aligned with the desired narrative. This wasn’t about fact-finding; it was theater, a performance engineered to defend and rationalize the questionable actions that had been taken, and the ones that were surely yet to come.

The broadcast switched to a live segment from Geneva, catching Zach’s attention. An official from the World Health Organization was mid-sentence. “…the inability of our scientists to rigorously evaluate the device has made it impossible to determine whether it is in violation. We look forward to testifying before the United States Congress and are taking a hard look at amendments to our Global Model Regulatory Framework for Medical Devices, which we concede are now dated and inadequate to deal with the speed at which technology is evolving.”

Zach’s jaw clenched. The implications of those words were clear, regulatory amendments, bureaucratic delays, a race against the clock he wasn’t sure they could win.

=== CHAPTER 33 ===

[SCENE: CH33_S01 | POV: Fiona | Location: FDA Office]

The room buzzed with the restless energy of too many agendas crammed into too small a space. Fiona Gile felt the oppressive weight of the room’s charged air, each competing agenda jostling for dominance in the cramped space.

Fiona watched Frank O’Hearn pace between clusters of FDA staff and bureaucrats, his expensive suit out of place among the government-issue furniture. He’d practically moved into their field office since Homeland Security had been forced to wind down their investigation.

“Commissioner Henning had no right or authority to destroy the evidence,” O’Hearn repeated for what felt like the hundredth time. The words struck Fiona as hollow echoes by now, their impact blunted by repetition. Next to him, a reverend, who Cray and Trout had added to their little group, nodded vigorously, his clerical collar wilting in the overheated room. The sight of the reverend’s fervor made Fiona’s jaw tighten; his righteousness grated on her frayed patience.

“This protocol has already broken people, and led them astray,” the reverend added. “It’s a virus in people’s minds, turning them away from Christ.” Fiona resisted the urge to roll her eyes, focusing instead on the taut expression of her partner. His silence mirrored her own thoughts, these declarations were mere noise, distractions from the crisis at hand.

Fiona exchanged a weary glance with her partner. The unspoken understanding between her and her partner was their only constant. Her partner looked as tired as she felt. The dark circles under his eyes were evidence of the sleepless nights they’d shared, haunted by the fallout from the tablet factory debacle. Their careers had nearly ended with that disaster. Now, they were tethered to this shadowy task force, even though they had been right about the mass production.

“We have something you’ll want to see,” Dr. Trout announced, appearing in the doorway. Fiona’s shoulders tensed at Trout’s sudden entrance, the director’s usually composed demeanor noticeably strained. “The first round of testing is ready.”

They followed her down a narrow corridor to what looked like an old interrogation room. The corridor’s cold fluorescent light hummed, matching the tight coil of anticipation twisting in Fiona’s chest. One wall was dominated by a one-way mirror, currently opaque. As they approached, the sense of foreboding deepened.

[SCENE: CH33_S02 | POV: Fiona | Location: FDA Office]

The assembled group crowded around a metal table as one of Trout’s staff began the briefing. Fiona kept her eyes on the staffer’s face, searching for any sign that this would be different, that they might finally find an answer instead of more questions.

“Subject is a 49-year-old female in good health. United States citizen, college educated, former special education teacher.” The clinical recitation hit Fiona like a sudden chill. Her fingers twitched, a reflexive response to a realization she was unwilling to accept.

Fiona felt her skin prickle with sudden dread. The name formed in her mind before she could stop it, a grim certainty hardening in her gut. She knew before the glass cleared who they would see.

The observation room lights revealed a scene that made her stomach clench. Sherry Carpenter. The woman was unrecognizable, stripped of her humanity by the sterile setup. Strapped to a chair, her head shaved and locked into a scaled-down MRI apparatus, EEG leads snaked across her scalp. Yet somehow, inexplicably, she was smiling.

“My God,” Fiona whispered. The words barely escaped her, the metallic taste of fear souring her tongue. Next to her, she felt her partner go rigid. His body stilled, tightened.

“The data is remarkable,” Trout said, pulling up brain scans on her tablet. The clinical detachment in Trout’s voice clashed with the horror gnawing at Fiona’s core. “Persistent alterations in default mode network connectivity. Increased neural plasticity in areas associated with self-referential processing. Complete reorganization of emotional regulation pathways.”

“Brain damage?” Cray asked eagerly, leaning forward. The question rang in Fiona’s ears, sharp and eager, an affront to the human suffering laid bare before them, despite the sufferer appearing to be fine with it.

“That’s the problem,” Trout replied. Fiona watched her, noting the tension etched into the director’s expression. “By conventional metrics, these changes appear beneficial. Decreased anxiety response, enhanced emotional regulation, improved cognitive flexibility. But the scale and permanence of the alterations…” Trout’s voice faltered, and Fiona felt a flicker of unease. “We’re talking about fundamental rewiring of human consciousness.”

“Like I said, a virus,” the reverend muttered. Fiona’s gaze shifted to him, irritation flaring at his persistent, simplistic take on the crisis.

“Not exactly.” Trout zoomed in on one scan. Fiona leaned closer, her eyes tracing the colorful web of neural pathways displayed on the screen. “There’s no damage or forced alterations. It’s more like the brain finding its optimal operating state. The changes are subtle, increased connectivity in attention networks, reduced activity in the default mode network, lasting changes in how the brain processes self-referential thoughts.”

The sterile technicality of Trout’s explanation did little to ease the knot in Fiona’s chest. This was a fundamental shift in what it meant to be human.

She glanced at the reverend and felt an unwelcome pang of recognition. Trout might admire his conviction, but from Fiona’s perspective, his certainty bordered on fanaticism. There were times, late in their strategy sessions, when Fiona caught the way Trout’s gaze would linger on him as if in awe. The unshakeable belief he embodied, that unyielding confidence that what they were doing was God’s work, was foreign to Fiona.

Where the reverend could rally with faith and righteousness, Fiona held on to the practicality that came with years in federal service, where black and white blurred into bureaucratic gray.

“You’re missing the point,” Cray cut in, derailing Fiona’s train of thought. He turned away from the window where he’d been studying Sherry, his eyes sharp with an intensity that made Fiona’s stomach tighten.

“Twenty-three years in this department. Started in counterterrorism, tracking groups trying to reshape society through force. The true believers were always the most dangerous, not because they were violent, but because they were convinced they were serving a higher purpose.” He gestured at Sherry. Fiona’s gaze flicked to the woman, strapped and eerily calm. “This is far more insidious, voluntary transformation of human consciousness itself.”

O’Hearn’s voice broke through the mounting silence, drawing Fiona’s attention back. “The Harbridge simulations,” he said, the phrase weighted with shared knowledge. “Like dominoes.”

“Exactly.” Cray began to pace, the tension in the room ratcheting up with each step. Fiona tracked his movement, feeling the impact of each pointed word settle like lead in her chest. “One person stops believing in money, property, social obligations? Not a problem. A thousand people? Manageable. But hit a certain percentage…” He jabbed a finger at the brain scans, the gesture as sharp as a warning. “The whole system collapses before we realize what’s happening.”

Trout’s nod was grim, confirming what Fiona feared. “We’ve seen it before. My first case at the FDA was a new antidepressant. Worked beautifully in trials, people felt better, functioned better. But six months in, we noticed something strange. People weren’t just happier, they were rejecting basic social contracts. Leaving jobs, ending relationships, withdrawing from society. Not because they were depressed, but because they no longer saw the point.”

A cold shiver ran down Fiona’s spine. The idea of society unraveling not from violence but from apathy was far more terrifying than any threat she’d faced in the field. “What happened?” she asked. The question hung in the room, unanswered, and Fiona felt a grim anticipation for what Trout would say next.

“We pulled it. Had to. Even though it was ‘working’ perfectly by medical standards,” Trout said, pulling up another file. Fiona leaned in, the tension coiling tighter in her chest. “Now look at these protocol users. Three months in: they stop shopping except for essentials. Stop pursuing career advancement. Stop engaging in social obligations. They’re not depressed or dysfunctional, they just step completely outside the social system.”

Fiona’s pulse quickened as she processed Trout’s words. The implications were staggering, more profound than any threat she’d faced in her career.

“And unlike your antidepressant, this change is permanent,” Cray added. “No going back.”

[SCENE: CH33_S03 | POV: Fiona | Location: FDA Office]

Through the glass, Sherry’s serene smile sent a chill down Fiona’s spine. The technicians moved around her, checking restraints and monitoring equipment, oblivious to the dissonance that struck Fiona to her core. She’d been part of the task force that brought Sherry in, believing they were protecting society from an unknown danger. Now, doubts crept in, relentless.

“The protocol’s supporters would say that’s exactly the point,” she found herself said, surprised by the tremor in her voice. “That society needs this kind of transformation.”

O’Hearn shot her a sharp look, but Trout nodded, her eyes weary but understanding. “They don’t understand that even beneficial changes need to happen gradually. Rapid transformation, even toward something ‘better,’ can tear a society apart.”

Fiona felt the weight of those words settle in her mind, heavy with truth.

“Sometimes protection requires prevention,” Cray said quietly. His voice carried an edge of resignation that made Fiona’s chest tighten further. “Even if people don’t understand what they’re being protected from.”

Trout gathered her files, her expression troubled. Fiona noted the deep lines around the director’s eyes. “They see enlightenment. We see destabilization.”

“And once those dominoes start falling…” Cray began.

“Better not to let them fall at all,” Trout finished.

As the others filed out, Fiona lingered, her gaze locked on Sherry through the glass. The woman’s smile never wavered, an unsettling contrast to the turmoil twisting inside Fiona. Sherry’s expression seemed to hold a secret, knowledge that eluded them all. It was as if she knew something Fiona feared they might never understand or accept.

“God save us,” she whispered, the words barely audible. But as she stared at Sherry’s peaceful face, a question took root: who needed saving more, Sherry, or them?

=== CHAPTER 34 ===

[SCENE: CH34_S01 | POV: Georgia | Location: Georgia's Office]

Georgia Sato opened the box and lifted out the headset. The February morning light streamed through her office windows, casting a warm glow over the polished surface of her desk. A small, folded sheet of instructions slipped to the floor as she admired the craftsmanship. She bent down to retrieve it, a soft chuckle escaping her lips when she noticed the single word emblazoned on the top fold.

“Awaken.” The sight of it made her smile wryly. She remembered the long debates over what that single word should be. From “end your suffering” to “be here now” to the stark, abrupt “wake up.”

Georgia unfolded the paper slowly, her eyes tracing the bold instructions laid out before her. Set aside your preconceptions. Find a comfortable place where you can sit for an hour or so undisturbed. Place the headset comfortably over your eyes. Adjust the earpieces so they are snug. Breathe. Press the button on the left side of the headset. Relax.

She flipped the paper over, noticing how ‘Awaken’ had been printed in each corner, ensuring visibility no matter how it was refolded. In the center, her gaze settled on the final message, obviously meant to be read after the user had followed the instructions on the first side. You are Awake. You have completed the Karmic Protocol. The program has reset itself and is ready for its next user.

A quiet sense of finality washed over her as she refolded the paper and set it back on the table. She picked up the headset again, running her fingers over the button on one side and the faintly etched ‘KP’ on the other. The lightness of it surprised her; so much intricate technology encapsulated in something so simple. The adjustable, padded straps and earpieces spoke of careful design, of meticulous intent. She couldn’t help but feel a surge of admiration.

Holding the headset, a thrill coursed through her, a sharp, electric anticipation. This was it: the algorithm to enlightenment, tangible and ready, promising to peel back the veils that had cloaked her mind for so long.

Georgia set it down gently, letting herself breathe deeply. Everything was in order, or as in order as it would ever be. The reins of her responsibilities had been passed on, the necessary papers signed, the accounts balanced.

Tim’s words echoed in her mind: enlightenment was inevitable for everyone; it was only a matter of timing. And here it was for her, here she stood, staring down at it in this moment. One more button to press, one more step. This would be her last incarnation. A wistful ache surfaced as she wished her grandfather could be beside her, sharing this journey.

Memories of conversations with Ed, her long meditations, even moments of whispered prayers, surfaced unbidden. Her grandfather would be proud; she felt that in the depths of her being. The words of the Buddha drifted back to her: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task is done. There is nothing further for this world.”

A profound serenity bloomed within her, soft and overwhelming, bringing tears to her eyes.

Getting up, Georgia dimmed the lights in her home office. There was no longer any need to wait, no need to strive, no need to suffer. Inevitability had found her. She placed the headset on, adjusting it until she was enveloped in complete darkness, reminding herself not to forget to breathe. Her fingers found the button on the side, the touch familiar and final, and she pressed it.

[SCENE: CH34_S02 | POV: Georgia | Location: Georgia's Office]

Later,time dissolved as she sat in meditation, the day and night merging into a seamless continuum after utilizing the protocol and removing the headset. Being, breathing, feeling the world. What needed to be done had been done. The sense of striving that had tethered her to this life had released its hold. The fuel that once fed her desires, aversions and suffering had been spent. There were no words, no thoughts, only awareness.

A knock on the door interrupted the quiet. The sound of knuckles rapping on wood cut through the stillness. The doorknob turned, metal components clicking softly, and the door eased open. A subtle shift in the air reached her, a whisper of a breeze.

A voice, familiar and tentative. “Georgia,” her assistant called, a note of hesitation in his tone. The door opened wider, his head peeking in.

“Yes,” she responded, her voice serene, suffused with compassion. He stepped inside, his movements careful as he approached the small bag on the table near the door. Slinging it over his shoulder, he continued into the room, the air shifting as he moved. He picked up the headset and placed it in the bag, the action done with practiced efficiency, just as they had practiced.

He turned back to her, his eyes searching for reassurance. “The car is waiting,” he said, the hint of urgency unmistakable. She followed him, leaving without a backward glance.

The hallway stretched before them, sterile and familiar. The press of the elevator button, the chime that announced its arrival, the mechanical hum as the doors parted. They stepped in, and he pressed the button for the garage. The doors slid closed, and the elevator began its descent. Georgia met his eyes, offering a gentle smile that made him shift uncomfortably.

“Thank you,” she said, her voice steady, almost tender.

“Of course,” he replied, a trace of tension easing from his posture. “We have a long ride ahead of us. Are you thirsty?”

She nodded. Yes, water. He was already reaching into the bag, pulling out a bottle. The cap twisted off with a scratch of plastic against plastic before he handed it to her. She drank, the cool water gliding over her lips and down her throat, grounding her in the moment.

“We have snacks in the car if you’re hungry,” he said, taking the bottle when she finished. He returned it to the bag with a practiced movement.

The elevator came to a stop, a slight jolt announcing their arrival. A chime, sharp and electronic, sounded from the speaker. The doors slid open to the basement garage, colder and more humid than the floors above.

The sound of rubber on concrete drew her attention as a car rounded the corner and pulled up in front of them. The assistant slid in first, shifting to make room for her. She settled into the seat, the door closing with a soft thud once she was inside. The car accelerated, and inertia pressed her back against the seat.

“To the cabin,” her assistant instructed before the car reached the garage exit. A chime from the car responded, longer and confirming.

He placed the bag on the floor and reached into a side compartment, pulling out a protein bar.

“How do you feel?” he asked, his eyes studying her face with concern.

Georgia turned to him, the weight of the question settling in the air. “I feel awake.”

=== CHAPTER 35 ===

[SCENE: CH35_S01 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

Lawrence Cray had never felt closer to having an honest-to-God aneurysm than on the day his boss, the Secretary of Homeland Security, dropped by his office unannounced to show him the karmic protocol headset that had been delivered to the Department that morning. The memory of that moment still boiled in his veins, the kind of anger so intense he could almost see a red haze creeping at the edges of his vision. The old saying about seeing red, he realized, was rooted in more than just exaggeration.

He’d been reliving that seething anger repeatedly over the past week as the full scale of the dissemination became clear. There had been a pattern, an infuriating logic, behind the deliveries. For every headset reported and confiscated, Cray knew several more were being hidden or used beyond their reach.

Reports began trickling in, scattered anecdotes of individuals using the headsets. While there hadn’t been any signs of a coordinated effort to bring people through the protocol like the one at the retreat center, Cray was acutely aware that it was only a matter of time. The strategy behind the distribution had been flawless, over five hundred units dispatched within a tightly orchestrated 48-hour window. Packages had reached religious institutions, meditation centers, and carefully chosen private individuals all at once. By the time anyone understood the scale, it was too late to intercept more than a fraction. The decentralized nature of the distribution only made containment more difficult; there was no singular entity to shut down or slap with a cease-and-desist.

The unlicensed medical device classification was useful, enabling them to seize units when found, but Cray knew it wasn’t enough. What they needed was legislation banning possession, usage or facilitation of the protocol. He scoffed at the thought; it would take a catastrophe to push Congress into passing that kind of law. Arresting every person who’d interacted with a headset was a fantasy they couldn’t indulge.

This disaster could have been prevented. If Henning and most of the administration hadn’t been so cowardly. If they’d allocated the same resources to him that other Under Secretaries had at the Department. If they had let him engage the media when Sato and Rice were out there reassuring the public that the protocol was too benign to worry about.

At least Cray had Frank O’Hearn to thank. Frank had mobilized the chambers of commerce, evangelicals, and, most critically, the big financial players. The media was finally shifting in their favor. Businesses, religious groups, and even politicians were starting to comprehend the implications. Meanwhile, the other side found themselves without a spokesperson to counter the momentum.

Sato hadn’t given a single interview since the story broke, and Carly Rice was presumably meditating somewhere in the woods. Cray couldn’t shake the feeling that those who had been brainwashed by the technology were no longer interested in spreading the word about it. Meanwhile, Goodman was back under surveillance, and his agents kept insisting they were closing in on Mulvaney, though Cray had his doubts.

[SCENE: CH35_S02 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

The intercom buzzed, pulling him from his spiral of thoughts. He glanced at it, realizing he’d been lost in his own mind again.

“Yes?” he said after shaking off the haze and pressing the button. Director Trout was here to see him. Good. “Show her in.”

Gwen Trout always dressed impeccably, always exuded professionalism, and today was no different. She entered the room alone, a file tucked under her right arm and her phone in hand. Pulling out a chair, she sat without waiting for an invitation, placing the file on her lap and tapping it with her phone.

“What have you got there, Director?” Cray asked, letting his gaze drop after holding eye contact as she walked in and settled into her seat.

“Good news,” she replied, allowing a small smile to flicker at the corners of her lips for the briefest moment.

“We need some,” Cray responded, standing and moving around his desk to pull out another chair closer to her.

“I think we have enough from our test subject to present to the administration.”

They had been probing one of the protocol victims for some time, their findings yielding mixed or inconclusive results.

“Enough what?” Cray asked, his eyebrows lifting as he couldn’t help but show his interest.

“Evidence of significant changes to the brain,” Trout answered, allowing the information to settle before continued, “beyond what our team can attribute to anything other than the protocol treatment.”

“Damage? Dementia? Tumors? Inflammation?” Cray fired off questions, his agitation barely masking the excitement that threatened to surface.

“Not exactly,” Trout said, opening the file and leafing through its pages until she found what she was searching for.

“Please tell me it’s meningitis, encephalitis,” he said, leaning in and squinting at the document, “Gehrig’s disease!”

“No, nothing like that,” she replied. “Neurogenesis, heightened plasticity, increased signaling entropy, hypo-connectivity in several regions, all sustained and off the charts.”

Damn, Cray thought. He didn’t fully understand the implications, but none of it sounded catastrophic. “No damage?” he pressed.

“No,” Trout confirmed. “No damage, but we have no way of knowing how long the human brain can maintain these activities or what the long-term effects could be. The point is, we have enough significant change from baseline readings of non-protocol users to argue for a temporary moratorium, and if we frame it right, maybe even push for criminalization.”

There it was, the breakthrough he’d been waiting for. Cray clapped his hands together with a sharp smack and stood up.

“Gwen, I knew there was a reason I liked you,” he said, turning to stride back to his desk. When he glanced back, he noticed a faint smile on her lips, though there was a subtle coolness in her eyes that suggested the feeling might not be entirely mutual. No matter. They had what they needed. “Let’s get this framed properly. I’ll handle my end.”

Trout nodded, closing the file and standing. “Lawrence, this isn’t going to stop the spread.”

“It’ll buy us the time and leverage we need to stop the people behind it.” He reached for the intercom, his finger pressing the button as he instructed his aide to connect him with the Secretary.

=== CHAPTER 36 ===

[SCENE: CH36_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Docks]

Tim sat on a bench, staring out over the vast, rippling ocean. The ship he was scheduled to board would depart in an hour. The others had already gone ahead, and he knew he should have joined them, but the thought of leaving without speaking to Georgia kept him rooted.

The thought of her joining the awakened brought a mix of emotions, pride tinged with regret. She had been one of their strongest allies, a loss the dharmapala would feel keenly. If only she had given them more time. But he knew it wasn’t his choice to make; it never had been. The wheel of fate was spinning now, and all he could do was try to guard it, not control its pace.

Still, she had done well. Georgia had secured the resources they needed to carry on their mission of spreading the protocol. For that, Tim was grateful. She’d also made arrangements for his core team’s passage abroad, a method slow enough to avoid attention but safe. He swallowed the bitter taste of loss; he would miss her.

Tim pulled the visor of his cap lower to block the setting sun’s glare. A wave of exhaustion washed over him, a reminder of the relentless pace he had kept since the protocol’s release. Maybe, just maybe, he could rest during the journey. The sudden tap on his shoulder shattered that hope.

“Timothy Mulvaney.” The voice behind him was clear and authoritative.

Tim’s breath hitched as he registered the name. He didn’t need to turn to recognize the speaker. A government agent, he thought. Not magic, just instinct honed through years of work. So close, he cursed silently.

“Your meeting with the Dalai Lama is going to have to wait,” Agent Gyle said, stepping into his peripheral vision. On the opposite side, another agent, whom Tim guessed was her partner, completed the pincer movement.

Tim’s mind churned as he pieced together how they had tracked him. The mention of His Holiness was telling. Georgia’s network of financiers had believed their destination was Dharamshala for a meeting with the revered Buddhist leader. A pang of disappointment dulled the sharp edge of his thoughts. He shouldn’t have expected any less.

Of course, the Dalai Lama was never part of their itinerary. The protocols they shipped to Dharamshala had been for his exiled government, not a personal audience. Their true aim lay deeper: the vast library at Sakya Monastery, where they intended to hide and begin digging through the largest collection of untranslated Buddhist scriptures in existence.

Tim removed his cap and sunglasses, setting them carefully on the bench. “It’s an honor to meet you,” he said, spreading his hands slightly to show he was unarmed.

The agents remained expressionless as they patted him down. Their silence spoke volumes as they guided him away from the bench, down the pier, and into a waiting van. Tim noted their subtle relief, their barely restrained smiles. They were satisfied with a clean apprehension, but it only fueled his resolve.

Tim managed a small smile, aware that even with his capture, it was too late to halt the awakening that had already begun. They placed a hood over his head and threw him into a waiting vehicle. The van rumbled beneath him, and he closed his eyes, hoping for a moment’s rest before the next phase of whatever awaited him. They drove for a long time, then escorted him into a building. After restraining him to a chair they left him alone. He waited.

[SCENE: CH36_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Blacksite]

The sudden removal of the black hood they’d placed over his head marked a shift. Tim couldn’t help a wry thought. It was classic for a group trying to project authority while bending the rules. Good guys, sure, he mused as he blinked against the harsh light, letting his eyes adjust. The room was bare, white-painted concrete walls surrounding him, with a single door and nothing but the chair he was tied to. Three strangers stood in a loose semi-circle, watching him. He hoped Finn wasn’t enduring anything like this in Dharamshala.

“Water,” he said, partly to quench the dryness in his throat but mostly to test the room, to break the silence.

The agent closest to him, clad in gear similar to Gile and her partner from their last encounter, stepped forward. Tim’s mind ticked through the possibilities. Homeland Security, maybe? The agent pulled a plastic bottle from a cargo pocket and approached. With a flick of his wrist, he produced a knife and cut the zip ties binding Tim’s hands. Tim flexed his wrists to get blood flowing before unscrewing the cap and drinking deeply, the water burning refreshingly down his parched throat.

“Was all of this really necessary?” Tim asked, setting the now-empty bottle aside.

“Shut up,” snapped another agent, his agitation evident in his restless pacing near the door. The first agent took the bottle back and returned it to his pocket, knife thankfully sheathed. Tim took stock; he wasn’t eager to test their limits, but he noted the absence of any more severe methods.

Moments later, the door creaked open, and Tim’s pulse quickened as Agent Gile walked in. At least this was a familiar face, one he could read, if not trust. The three unknown agents filed out, leaving the room silent but charged as the door shut behind them.

“Agent, I’ve answered every question you’ve asked, honestly and completely,” Tim said, his voice steady despite the strain. He felt marginally safer with Gile than with the rougher trio who had just left.

“That only proves we haven’t asked the right questions yet,” she said, flipping open a notepad. “Your compliance has been duly noted, Mr. Mulvaney,” Agent Gile said, stepping closer, her eyes scanning him carefully.

Tim rubbed his wrists again, wincing at the red marks left by the zip ties. “They didn’t do any visible damage, if that’s what you’re checking for,” he said, letting a hint of sarcasm edge his words.

“We’re fully aware of what they did and didn’t do,” Gile responded sharply, scribbling something on his notepad.

Tim’s muscles tensed as Gile’s eyes bore into him. “We need to know where the equipment used to manufacture the protocol is currently hidden or being used to produce more protocols,” she said, her tone unyielding.

“I wasn’t lying when I said I didn’t know,” Tim replied, a dry cough punctuating his words. The truth, as frustrating as it was. The components had been split up, and the teams responsible for moving them had done so independently. Even if he was inclined to talk, which he wasn’t, there was nothing to give up. Not even torture would change that.

“And the code?” Gile pressed, not breaking eye contact.

Tim exhaled slowly. “I told you, the code was uploaded to a hundred different cloud servers, set to replicate and forward at specified intervals.” They’d realize the truth in that out soon enough if they hadn’t already. The safeguards were tight, encryption so advanced it would erase itself without the correct authentication from one of a dozen key holders.

Gile’s expression hardened. “How do we open the headsets without them destroying themselves?”

It was the hundredth time she’d asked him this question. Tim knew all she was doing now was confirming she hadn’t cracked it.

He exhaled, a touch of exasperation escaping. “Please, again, do I look like a tech guy to you? I have no idea.”

“Who does?” Gile asked, her eyes narrowing. “Goodman? Sato?”

Tim’s gut twisted, wondering if they had Zach and Georgia. “Why don’t you take the bags off their heads and ask them yourself?” he shot back, voice steady but probing for a reaction.

Gile didn’t so much as blink. Her stone face offered nothing, revealing no hints about any other detainees.

“Listen,” Gile said after a brief pause, her tone measured, “I understand you’re not a tech guy, and you’re probably not a coder, either. But you did introduce this untested medical device into the market, and we need to stop you from unleashing more, causing more damage.”

“Damage?” Tim barked out a laugh, the sound ricocheting off the concrete walls, perhaps a bit louder than he intended. “Damage to whom? The government? The business community? Your Christian friends? What exactly is an enlightened populace going to damage? Democracy? Capitalism? The Catholic Church?” He shook his head, disbelief etched into his features.

“All of that, yes,” Gile said, undeterred. “And possibly irreversible changes to neural networks, synapse control, brain chemistry. Your reckless actions have caught the attention of the World Health Organization, human rights groups, and nearly every government on the planet.”

Tim’s chest tightened at the thought of the tests being conducted on the awakened, brain scans, imaging. He hoped they were humane, but he doubted it. The awakened weren’t children, they were modern buddhas, but just because they had extinguished suffering didn’t mean they were impervious to pain.

“Shipping these things internationally wasn’t your brightest idea,” she added, a smirk barely perceptible. “In all honesty, you’re lucky we got to you first. Anyway, we’re done here. The FDA will officially deem the protocol a schedule one hybrid drug device tomorrow, so this entire mess will become the DEA’s problem. Good riddance.”

The pieces clicked in Tim’s mind. A strategic move. They would stash him in a dark corner, hopefully alive, while ordering the seizure of every headset in circulation.

“You’re just prolonging the inevitable,” Tim said, his voice calm and resolute. He wanted them to know he’d come to terms with his fate. “The protocol is an accelerant. It doesn’t do anything that a person couldn’t achieve on their own with enough time and insight.”

“We’ll feel better letting them achieve it naturally,” Gile said, unbothered, continued to jot notes in her little pad.

She turned and knocked on the door. The sound echoed, signaling the end.

“Tell Cray I said hello,” Tim muttered one last dig as the trio of agents returned, zip ties and black hood in hand.

=== CHAPTER 37 ===

[SCENE: CH37_S01 | POV: Jessica | Location: Yost's Office]

“I didn’t want to believe our own government was capable of this,” Senator Yost said, pacing the floor. His voice echoed off the polished wood panels of the Senate office, a sharp contrast to the deep silence weighing down the room. Jessica sat in the corner, her notepad balanced on her knee, the tension drawing her shoulders tight.

“Still nothing about the whereabouts of Georgia Sato?” he asked, his gaze darting to Jessica.

“No,” she replied, steadying her voice as she made a quick note. The absence of updates felt like an itch she couldn’t reach. “Tim Mulvaney is still missing too, along with several others the government believes to be involved. The administration denies any knowledge of anyone disappearing.”

“Being disappeared,” Paul Freemont, the Senator’s Chief of Staff, interjected, his tone biting through the unease.

Jessica’s jaw tightened as she nodded. “Yes, being disappeared, sir,” she echoed, the phrase digging into her mind like a splinter. The pieces didn’t fit, but it was becoming harder to ignore the signs that pointed to an overreach by Homeland Security or another shadowed agency.

Jessica couldn’t help the chill that settled in her chest. Georgia Sato’s sudden vanishing gnawed at her, but it was Tim’s absence that kept her awake at night. Dharamshala had been his intended destination, a carefully orchestrated escape. Now, every missed check-in only confirmed her fears: he’d been intercepted.

“If I may, gentlemen,” she said, leaning forward, hoped to keep her voice measured, “perhaps a more public appeal is needed. Our briefings have stalled, and with the hearing coming up, state and federal information sharing feels more critical than ever.”

The Senator paused, considering her words with a furrowed brow. “Perhaps,” he muttered.

Paul sighed, lifting his hands as if the weight of the situation might lift with the gesture. “We could ask the Governor to issue an official public request for information.”

Jessica glanced at the Senator, catching the fleeting frustration in his expression. “I’ve already tried her office, Paul,” he said, shoulders falling. “It’s too risky for her. They’re in ‘wait and see’ mode.”

“Georgia’s not a big enough donor?” Paul quipped, earning a brief, unexpected laugh from Jessica. The tension cracked for just a moment, and the Senator’s pacing stopped as he turned and allowed a smirk.

Jessica watched as the Senator checked his watch, then picked up his laptop from a table in the corner. “I need to work on my testimony,” he said, the resolve in his voice hardened like a blade. “This hearing might be our chance to make an appeal or at least push the press to ask the right questions.”

[SCENE: CH37_S02 | POV: Jessica | Location: Yost's Office]

The room shifted as he left. Paul’s eyes met Jessica’s, his shrug resigned but knowing.

“He’s going into the lion’s den,” she said softly once the door clicked shut, a pulse of worry running through her.

Paul’s smile was small but certain. “It’s what he lives for,” he said, standing up with a stretch. “Especially after being surrounded by federal agents while a class of his constituent’s children got the field trip of a lifetime.”

“I was there, Chief,” Jessica reminded him, the memory as sharp as broken glass. “Doesn’t change the fact that the only reason Congress is letting him testify is because this happened in his district.”

“That, and we have friends on the Committee of Inquiry,” Paul added as he reached for the door. “In the meantime, check again if the state police have turned up anything on Sato. Yost is obviously concerned for her safety.”

Jessica watched him go, the door closing behind him with a muted thud. The state police, much like the Governor’s office, would avoid this mess. No one wanted to touch it, not with stakes this high and risks this volatile. She rubbed her temple, frustration pulsing beneath her skin. There had to be another way to find out if Cray or someone else had gotten to Tim. Arresting him outright would be too public, too official, it would have guaranteed him a lawyer.

For a moment, she sat still, her weight heavy in the chair. Admitting it, even to herself, was hard: Jessica Everett was stumped. Contacting Zach or any of the other dharmapalas was out of the question, with one possible exception. A sliver of hope stirred as she reached for her private cell phone and powered it on, the screen’s glow casting a pale light across her determined features.

Who else at Homeland Security could she approach? Agent Gile. The memory of the tablet factory incident surfaced, a sharp reminder of the tension-filled briefing where Cray had pushed her and another agent forward to placate the Senator. She’d never expected to speak to Gile again, but she still had her card somewhere.

A sudden realization struck her: Senator Yost might be digging deeper than she’d thought in preparation for his testimony. He might be seeking an off-the-record insight, something unofficial, to bolster his stance. Jessica felt a rush of determination flooding her veins as she stood, already scanning her desk for the card.

=== CHAPTER 38 ===

[SCENE: CH38_S01 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

“Inadequate to deal with the speed at which the technology seems to be evolving.” The speaker’s words filtered into Lawrence Cray’s consciousness, half-heard as he sifted through the report in front of him. The interview played on, a constant, annoying background reminder of the public’s ignorance. He snapped the ‘Project Roundup’ folder shut, his fingers tapping it once before he sighed.

The arguments made against his proposal felt familiar, even predictable. His fellow bureaucrats kept citing history, invoking the darkest comparisons. Cray’s jaw clenched. They didn’t grasp the reality of the situation—these people were compromised, infected in a way that demanded intervention. Deprogramming was the bare minimum.

To keep panic at bay, officials had insisted on the mantra that human-to-human transmission was impossible. Cray scoffed inwardly. The pacification they observed in the infected was enough for him to believe otherwise. The only way forward was containment, studying each case, and finding a solution before it spiraled out of control.

Resistance had come from unexpected quarters. He recalled the shock of facing nearly as much opposition to the notion of a cure as to rounding up the infected. Journalists reporting on the good protocol victims were doing. It was maddening. If they refused to see the victims for what they were, casualties of a twisted protocol, then what reason did they have to fear it?

Cray’s thoughts shifted, gratitude welling up for Gwen Trout and her relentless research. Without her findings, the push for criminalization might have faltered. The precedent was there, darker than any measures he’d put forward, to justify stopping the spread before it was too late.

With one last look at the folder, he tossed it into the waste bin. A flash of discouragement swept over him but quickly ebbed. Vindication had come, and with it, more work to be done. Public opinion could be left to O’Hearn and his cohorts; Cray’s team was here to carry out the necessary, unglamorous tasks.

Support wasn’t limited to domestic circles either. His mind ticked over his recent alliances, foreign actors with fewer qualms and more urgency than the methodical World Health Organization. He glanced at his calendar, confirming the upcoming meeting with Vatican security. A smile tugged at his lips as he remembered the reverend’s outrage at being excluded from the gathering.

Cray could already predict the Vatican’s stance: an impassioned warning about the protocol’s threat to their sovereignty and legitimacy, and a plea for his government’s assistance. They didn’t need to worry about convincing him. This was a battle they could fight together, each side offering what the other lacked.

Cray opened the file Gile had sent him on the Mulvaney interrogation, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the contents. Video clips were embedded throughout, each one more damning than the last. He clicked on a few and let them play, a low frustration simmering inside him. Evidence like this would be explosive in the upcoming congressional inquiry, but he knew better than to suggest it. The moment those recordings were scrutinized, so would the methods Homeland Security used to obtain them. The last thing he needed was to shift the spotlight onto himself. No, there was already enough ammunition without inviting chaos.

But the Vatican could use these. Cray slipped on his earpiece and fast-forwarded through the footage, pausing at the most incriminating segments. Mulvaney’s demeanor was chilling. He wasn’t a fanatic denouncing religion, capitalism or democracy; he simply didn’t care. The danger he had unleashed was just collateral damage to his so-called vision, an existential threat to institutions Cray valued.

Cray’s brows knitted as the video revealed Mulvaney’s detached commentary. The man displayed equal indifference toward the exiled Tibetan government, the Catholic Church, and the Pope himself. Whether it was socialism, dictatorship, or democracy, Mulvaney dismissed them all with the same nonchalance. From everything he could tell, what mattered to him was the freedom for people to “escape suffering” through his twisted experiment.

Cray’s fingers tightened around the edge of his desk as he stopped the video. How could anyone be so self-deluded, so utterly blind? And the most glaring revelation of all, Mulvaney hadn’t undergone the protocol himself. To Cray, it was the hallmark of a hypocrite, a leader who urged others to drink the poison while keeping his own cup dry. The man wasn’t just dangerous; he was a coward.

With a sharp inhale, Cray shifted his attention to his inbox, scrolling for updates on Georgia Sato. She’d vanished from public view after the protocol’s release. Common sense suggested he let her be, but that wasn’t Cray’s way. She needed to be held accountable, not just for financing the manufacturing but for possibly even spreading the protocol further. His eyes darkened with determination. Whatever she was plotting, he would find out and make her pay.

Cray had entrusted Gile with the mission of tracking down Georgia Sato and bringing her in. Their success with Mulvaney had proven their capability, and he trusted they would manage this as well. Sato couldn’t stay hidden forever. Someone like her, with sprawling business interests, would inevitably leave a trace, a signature on a document or an appearance in a boardroom. They’d find her; it was only a matter of time.

After scanning his messages and finding no updates, Cray’s mind shifted. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small key, the cold metal grounding him for a moment. Rising from his chair, he pressed against the edge of a painting on the wall. It popped forward, revealing a hidden safe, a precaution he had insisted upon when he first stepped into the role of Under Secretary. Over the years, countless sensitive documents had found temporary refuge within its walls.

With practiced precision, Cray placed his thumb on the biometric scanner. The safe clicked softly, prompting a sequence: a retinal scan, followed by the rhythmic tapping of a sixteen-digit passcode, and finally, the insertion of the key. The process was methodical, a ritual of security that both reassured and reminded him of the stakes.

A low chime signaled success, and the safe door eased open. Nestled inside was a sleek black virtual reality headset, its surface gleaming under the dim office light. The letters KP were etched on its side, a subtle mark of significance that sent a ripple of tension through him.

“So much chaos caused by such a little device,” he muttered, shaking his head.

=== CHAPTER 39 ===

[SCENE: CH39_S01 | POV: Fiona | Location: Fiona's Office]

“Hello, Agent Gile, this is Jessica Everett, from Senator Yost’s office. I was hoping to talk with you off-the-record about the Senator’s upcoming testimony. If you could call me back at your earliest convenience, I would appreciate it.”

Gile erased the message with a flick of her thumb, agita sinking deeper in her chest. She glanced up from her phone, meeting her partner’s expectant eyes across the cluttered desk.

“Anything on Sato?” she asked, her voice steady, betraying no hint of the frustration simmering inside.

“Not a thing,” he responded. He resumed typing, his expression shifting back to the detached focus she’d come to expect from him.

Gile’s jaw tightened. No leads, no angles, just the void Sato had left behind. It was like she’d vanished into thin air. She stole another look at her phone, the call from Yost’s office gnawing at her. It felt like a long shot, but maybe, just maybe, they had something.

[SCENE: CH39_S02 | POV: Fiona | Location: Fiona's Office]

Standing up, Gile decided she needed space. Her partner didn’t need to see this play out. She walked briskly down the hall, away from the watchful eyes of the task force, and dialed the number.

Jessica’s voice answered on the first ring. “Agent Gile, thanks for calling me back.”

“Of course, but I’m not sure what I can help with. Anything official should go through Cray’s office,” Gile replied, forcing an even tone. She could hear the edge in her own voice, betraying the weariness that had crept in over weeks of dead-end searches.

“Oh, nothing official, just a couple of background issues,” Jessica said, her voice lowering slightly, like she was leaning in. “The Senator is trying to wrap his head around this thing, and I figured I’d go to the source and see if you had any insight we couldn’t get through…uh…proper channels.”

Gile’s fingers tightened around the phone. “I’m just a field agent, as you know, but I’ll try to be of help.”

“Well, first off, and this is a long shot,” Jessica said, dropping her voice further, “we have a short list of constituents we’ve lost contact with since this whole thing blew up. I know it’s all confidential, high-level stuff, but…”

“Who?” Gile cut in, a thread of tension winding tighter.

“Georgia Sato, for one,” Jessica said. “We tried to contact her about the hearing and have spent weeks trying to locate her, which seems odd.”

A cold realization settled over Gile. Pointless. This phone call wasn’t going to give her any new leads. “I must admit, it’s odd to us as well that, right after these headsets were distributed, the person we believed to be involved in their manufacture goes missing.”

“So, you’re looking for her too?”

Gile kept her response measured. “We are looking for several people we’d like to interview in relation to the case, and yes, Georgia Sato is one of those people.”

Unfortunately, Gile couldn’t offer much. “I can’t help you; we haven’t been able to contact her for an interview. To be honest, I was hoping your office might have some information.”

“I wish we did,” Jessica replied, her voice carrying an undertone of genuine regret. “How about Tim Mulvaney?”

Gile stiffened, letting the question hang in the silence. How did Yost’s office even know who Mulvaney was? She cleared her throat, keeping her tone controlled. “What is the Senator’s interest in Mulvaney?”

“As I mentioned, we have a few constituents unaccounted for. Mulvaney made that speech about the protocol at the industry conference. He keeps an apartment in the district, and we were trying to reach him for the testimony. Has Homeland Security managed to,” Jessica’s voice dropped a note, “interview him?”

“No, no,” Gile said, her reply coming out a beat too fast. “Homeland Security hasn’t interviewed Mr. Mulvaney.”

“But you know where he is,” Jessica pressed, more statement than question.

Gile’s pulse quickened. This line of questioning was venturing into dangerous territory. If Yost’s office had gotten wind of Trout’s maneuvers at the FDA, it could complicate things further.

“I don’t,” Gile said, which, for now, was true enough. Mulvaney hadn’t been released, but where he was, or which agency had him now was unclear. Trout planned to hand him over to the FBI, but that was where her knowledge ended.

“There are a few more names on our list,” Jessica continued, seeming to ease off, “but I’d rather not put anything in writing. What I really need to know is if you can share any off-the-record information about where these headsets were manufactured. Did the Administration track down the real facility?”

“Off the record,” Gile said, lowering her voice slightly, “we did. The facility wasn’t tied to Sato, and it was abandoned by the time we got there.”

“Was it in our district? And were there any arrests?” Jessica asked. “We managed to reach Carly Rice, but she didn’t know anything significant.”

“Location isn’t important since it wasn’t technically illegal when it happened. There have been no arrests, no warrants,” Gile said, the fatigue pressing into her words. “Unless someone starts manufacturing these headsets again, that’s how it will probably stay. And yes, we share your view about Rice.”

“Thanks, Agent Gile,” Jessica said. “One last question. Homeland Security is going to support the permanent criminalization of the protocol at the hearing, correct?”

“That’s way above my pay grade,” Gile replied, knowing full well nothing could keep Cray from testifying. “To my knowledge, Homeland Security is leaving the testimony to the FDA scientists and the World Health Organization.”

“Probably for the best,” Jessica said before the line clicked dead.

Gile pocketed her phone, the conversation looping in her head. Why was Yost’s office so keen on Sato and Mulvaney? The possibility of the Senator being involved was unsettling, but it didn’t matter now. Sato was the last lead.

She stepped back into the office, the hum of keyboards and muted chatter greeting her. Her partner looked up, eyes curious. “Any luck?”

“No,” she said, her voice clipped. “Do you know what they’ve done with Mulvaney?”

He shrugged. “Don’t know, don’t care.”

“Same here,” Gile muttered. If she ever saw him again, it would be too soon. They shared a brief, humorless laugh before diving back into their work.

=== CHAPTER 40 ===

[SCENE: CH40_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Blacksite]

Tim looked briefly around his cell, then lay back on the cot and closed his eyes. The wheel was in motion.

Recalling the admonition of the one of his handlers, “You think you’ve done the world a favor? Countries are tearing themselves apart trying to decide whether to embrace your ‘truth’ or bury it under martial law,” he couldn’t help but smile.

He recognized that change comes gradually, and that many people find comfort in familiar perspectives, even when those perspectives bring them pain. The concept of impermanence and suffering remained universal human experiences that everyone eventually confronts in their own way. Some would find insight through witnessing how others navigated these challenges. They had offered a perspective on managing life’s inherent difficulties, but couldn’t force anyone to accept it.

I am responsible for the effort, not the outcome, Tim reminded himself. His effort now needed to focus on maintaining composure despite his predicament. One of his favorite lines of poetry drifted to mind: be still and wait without hope, for hope would be hope of the wrong thing.

He was stuck here until those in power decided he wasn’t a threat anymore. No one would mount a rescue mission; he was certain of that. An escape attempt would only stoke their fears. No, he was here for the duration. He would keep answering their questions and thanking them for their so-called hospitality. He reminded himself that those hardest to love were often the ones who needed it most, but this situation was testing that belief to its limit.

Tim’s thoughts turned inward, revisiting the code. He visualized each line, the acceleration of insight, the foundation of awareness, the truth of suffering. Somewhere beyond the walls of his cell, the world was fracturing. He imagined markets someday freezing, the hum of commerce reduced to silence as ambition gave way to stillness. Governments teetering, some lashing out to suppress the new truth, others crumbling under its weight. Traditions long revered beginning to wither, their rituals exposed as hollow in the face of deeper understanding. Yet in that chaos, he could foresee something blooming, a quiet, enduring resolve in those who had embraced the awakening.

[SCENE: CH40_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Blacksite]

A sound interrupted his thoughts, a keycard unlocking the cell door.

Tim opened his eyes as a nondescript, well-dressed man stepped in. The door remained ajar, an unexpected detail that sharpened Tim’s attention.

“Mr. Mulvaney,” the man said, taking a step further into the cell while glancing around. “I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience your detainment has caused.”

Tim blinked, uncertain if he had heard correctly. “Apologize?”

“Yes,” the man said, stepping aside so the cell door remained unblocked. “Our counterparts at Homeland Security are a bit rough around the edges.”

Tim’s confusion deepened. “Your counterparts?” The words felt hollow as they left his mouth.

The man shrugged. “As soon as you were transferred into the custody of the Bureau, we started working on getting you out of here.”

“The Bureau?” Tim repeated, the disbelief apparent in his voice.

The man continued as if on autopilot. “I’m afraid I don’t have many answers, probably none. The good news is, you’re free to go.” He gestured toward the open door.

“Go where?” Tim asked, the question escaping before he could temper his reaction. The sudden shift felt surreal, like stepping from a dream into a trap.

“Anywhere you like,” the man said calmly. “Your interview is over, and the Bureau has no basis, or interest, in holding you any longer.”

Tim’s mind raced. Classic ‘release and catch’ tactic, he thought. They would release him, shadow his movements, watch who he contacted. It would mean constant vigilance, but it was still preferable to confinement. He moved hesitantly to the threshold, only realizing he was unsure of which direction to take as he paused. Glancing back, he saw the agent pointing to the left.

He followed the corridor, each step feeling deliberate and weighted. Where am I being released from? He had no idea if he was still in the same city or had been moved states away. The brightness ahead caught his attention, and he squinted as sunlight filtered through the windows near what appeared to be an exit.

“Your belongings are bagged up on the counter there,” came the voice from behind him. “Can’t vouch that everything’s there, but that’s what they sent along.”

Tim picked up the black bag, the weight oddly familiar. Is this the same bag they put over my head when they took me? The man’s words echoed in his mind. The interview is over. No basis or interest in keeping me. He slung the bag over his shoulder without checking its contents. Everything in here will need to be destroyed, he thought, including the clothes on his back. Can’t risk any hidden bugs, electronic or otherwise.

The Bureau agent brushed past him and pushed open the door, revealing what looked like an ordinary office building lobby. “You’re not far from where they said they picked you up, closer to downtown than the pier,” the man said, reaching into his breast pocket and pulling out an envelope.

Tim’s eyes narrowed. “What’s this?” he asked, taking the envelope.

“Cab fare,” the agent replied before stepping out onto the sidewalk. Tim peered inside; the envelope held more cash than a simple cab ride would cost, along with a small slip of paper. Suspicion prickled at him. This keeps getting stranger.

“So, no warnings or conditions?” Tim asked, scanning the street as he oriented himself.

“Nope,” the agent said flatly. Without another word, he turned back, disappeared into the building, and locked the door behind him.

[SCENE: CH40_S03 | POV: Tim | Location: Street]

The winter wind bit into Tim’s thin jacket, a sharp reminder of the two months that had slipped away since his detention began in December 2027. He started walking, letting his feet guide him in the direction of his apartment. When he was confident no one was tailing him, he stopped in a shadowed alley and opened the envelope again.

The slip of paper held a handwritten message: “Conditions are subject to ceaseless change, strive onwards with care.”

A phrase attributed to the Buddha, and one that seemed to settle into him like a final, silent instruction.

=== CHAPTER 41 ===

[SCENE: CH41_S01 | POV: Sherry | Location: FDA Office]

Sherry’s eyes were closed, but she felt the bright, sterile light of the room pressing through her eyelids, a harsh contrast to the quiet darkness she longed for. She sensed the young technician’s approach, his presence timid yet dutiful, marked by the soft rustle of his white coat and the tremble of his fingers as he attached the blood pressure cuff to her arm. The cool wrap of the cuff, the clinical efficiency of his movements, they all served as reminders of how far her body had been pushed, yet she felt no anger toward him.

His worry was palpable, a silent companion through the endless series of tests that stripped away any remnants of comfort. She knew he was haunted by it; the rigid protocols, the unwavering pursuit of data, and the slow degradation of what he once considered humane. Sherry sensed the exhaustion in his sighs, the way he held himself rigid to maintain the illusion of detachment. But his eyes betrayed him, she’d caught them lingering on her face with a rare softness, as though searching for answers she alone could give.

They both knew she wasn’t the first person he had analyzed. She could feel the weight of it, the ghosts of those who had endured the same. And yet, there was something different in her, a quiet thread of acceptance woven through her bones, that puzzled and disturbed the staff. No resistance, no pleas. Just a calm that unnerved them all. She was aware of how they looked at her when they thought she wouldn’t notice, the whispered phrases as they interpreted the data, “subtle but measurable changes… enhanced neural plasticity…,” as though her brain were adapting on its own terms, bending but not breaking.

Pain had become her shadow, lingering behind every heartbeat, every breath. She knew they thought her resilience was somehow unnatural, perhaps even a fluke. But it was not resilience. She was simply beyond suffering, anchored instead by something deeper, something they could never probe or measure.

As the technician recorded her blood pressure, she sensed his inner turmoil, a wave of sorrow, worry, yet also a glimmer of love, protective and fierce. She let herself lean into it, feeling the warmth radiating from his being, wrapping around her as if she could somehow draw from it.

“Your daughter will be fine. The fever will break tonight,” she murmured softly, without opening her eyes. Her words seemed to freeze him. She didn’t need to see his face to know that her statement had unsettled him deeply. She felt the tremor in his hands as he completed the reading, but she sensed no anger, only a lingering sadness, perhaps about what his life had become. She saw his frown as he realized the ramifications of what he saw on her chart.

The room had grown quieter since they removed the heart monitor yesterday. The team spoke in clipped tones now, their words devoid of empathy, discussing her future like a sterile transaction. Sherry knew they had been considering releasing her, returning her to her previous life, as though she could go back to the mundane, predictable existence. But that life was a shell, a placeholder for the truth she now carried within. She was beyond the tangible world, her spirit drifting somewhere they couldn’t follow.

Later, when the young technician returned, his presence was more hesitant. She felt his fingers brush her wrist, warm but uncertain. She saw him add something to her IV. In that brief moment, she felt a wave of pity for him. She sensed his soul’s quiet rebellion, the conflict brewing between his compassion and the chains of proper procedure binding him here.

Then, the stillness descended. She felt herself slipping from this life, her spirit releasing its hold on the physical, floating beyond the reach of the cold, metallic space. She felt no resistance, no fear, only a gentle, settling peace. Her world narrowed to the rhythmic beep, the cool metal beneath her palm, and the quiet presence at her side. When even that slipped away, the silence was broken only by the young technician’s quiet, resolute words: “This is it for me. I’m not coming back.”

=== CHAPTER 42 ===

[SCENE: CH42_S01 | POV: Lawrence | Location: House Chamber]

The polished oak panels and heavy blue drapes of the House chamber seemed designed to make witnesses feel small, but they were having the opposite effect on Lawrence Cray. The Under Secretary sat straight at the testimony table, practically vibrating with contained energy as he waited for the chairman to begin. The hearing was his stage, and today, he needed to deliver a performance that would shift the tide in their favor.

“The Committee will come to order,” Chairman Roberts intoned, his voice steady and authoritative. “Today, we examine the societal and economic implications of the so-called karmic protocol.”

Cray adjusted the microphone in front of him, glancing briefly at the packed chamber. Journalists perched like vultures in the press gallery, their eyes scanning for weakness. To their left, a cluster of executives from rival tech firms whispered in hushed tones. Cray caught a flicker of motion near the front row, Frank O’Hearn jotting furious notes, his intensity radiating across the room.

Taking a measured breath, Cray leaned forward. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my twenty-five years of public service, I have never encountered a more insidious threat to our nation’s security and social fabric.”

The words fell heavily, as he intended. But as Cray continued, he caught subtle shifts in the room. Representative Green tilted her head slightly, her skeptical expression flickering like a warning light. Cray pressed on, his tone rising. “The protocol systematically alters fundamental motivational structures. We’re seeing this already as more than we thought possible are using it. Goldman Sachs lost 20% of their top traders last quarter, not to competitors, but to resignation and withdrawal. Federal agencies are reporting an alarming trend of employees taking extended leave and returning markedly ‘changed.’ The Atlanta Police Department is struggling to fill their riot squad, and some departments report officers refusing to perform basic enforcement duties after achieving enlightenment.”

Scanning the Committee he continued, “In the corporate world, three Fortune 500 CEOs have recently redirected entire R&D budgets to environmental restoration projects, citing newfound clarity about their companies’ role in society. This isn’t philanthropy, it’s a fundamental shift in priorities driven by the protocol. Even the military isn’t immune. Pentagon reports detail units rendered unreliable after multiple members achieved enlightenment, compromising readiness and operational cohesion.”

Pausing to take a drink of water, Cray straightened further in his chair and continued, “These aren’t isolated incidents. Across every major institution, we see withdrawals from economic and civic activities that form the backbone of societal stability. Traditional rewards, career advancement, monetary gain, social status, lose their grip, and the results are destabilizing to the point of systemic risk.”

Green leaned forward, her lips curling into a faint smile that Cray instantly disliked. “Forgive me, Mr. Cray,” she began, her tone smooth, “but are you suggesting that disengagement from consumer culture is a national security threat?”

A smattering of chuckles rippled through the room. Cray’s pulse quickened. He forced a tight smile, his fingers curling against his notes. “I’m suggesting, Representative, that the destabilizing effects of mass withdrawal, economic, social, and political, cannot be underestimated.”

Green didn’t back down. “You’ve mentioned simulations in your prepared remarks, but what about real-world data? Are there cases of violence? Delusions? Paranoia? Anything to suggest this protocol poses an immediate danger?”

Her tone was surgical, each question cutting away at his carefully constructed argument. Cray tightened his grip on the table’s edge, his composure slipping. “The effects are subtler than that,” he replied, choosing his words carefully. “Consider the Harbridge simulations, cascading disruptions across industries, infrastructure, even governance. It’s not just about individuals; it’s the system as a whole.”

Cray glanced at Chairman Roberts, hoping for intervention, but the chairman remained impassive. The room hummed with unease, and Cray could feel the narrative slipping from his grasp. He stole another glance at O’Hearn, who was scribbling furiously, his jaw tight. The message was clear: Cray needed to regain control.

He pivoted, his voice sharpening. “This is not merely an academic concern. We have documented cases of individuals abandoning careers, severing economic ties, and disrupting their communities. When multiplied across thousands, or millions, of participants, the consequences are catastrophic.”

The word “catastrophic” landed like a hammer, silencing the murmurs. Cray allowed himself a small breath of relief. The moment was tenuous, but he had reasserted some authority.

“Thank you, Under Secretary,” Chairman Roberts finally said, breaking the silence with a perfunctory tone.

[SCENE: CH42_S02 | POV: Lawrence | Location: House Chamber]

Cray stepped down from the witness table, his footsteps measured despite the heat rising in his chest. He slid into a seat near the back of the chamber, his eyes scanning the room. The faint shuffle of papers and hushed conversations filled the pause before the next speaker was called. He tapped at the screen of his tablet, pulling up the intelligence reports he couldn’t stop thinking about.

His hand hovered over the screen as the session resumed. Another speaker, a digital ministry director from First Life Church, took the stand. Cray tuned out the opening pleasantries, his focus divided between the unfolding hearing and the implications on his screen. The clock was ticking faster than he had anticipated.

Cray looked up just as the speaker launched into a fiery critique of the protocol, describing it as “a tool for dismantling divine order.” The words barely registered. His gaze lingered on the senators’ faces, noting who nodded along and who shifted uncomfortably in their seats. The hearing wasn’t over, but his strategy was already moving beyond it.

Sliding his tablet shut, Cray leaned back in his chair, his face impassive. Let them argue theology and philosophy. He would sway them here, but the real battle was taking place far beyond these walls, and Cray intended to win it.

=== CHAPTER 43 ===

[SCENE: CH43_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's House]

Zach flicked on the television, the screen casting a faint blue glow across the darkened room. A stern-faced anchor filled the air with an urgency Zach had grown too tired to feel.

“Breaking News from Wall Street: Major investment firm Blackstone announces a temporary trading suspension amid key staff departures. Sources report senior traders have resigned without notice. Meanwhile, a major fast-food franchise has quietly suspended operations at three locations, citing ‘staffing irregularities.’ In Silicon Valley, tech giant Oracle faces internal upheaval as development teams have…”

The voice trailed off in Zach’s mind as he rubbed his temples, but the words lingered like static, prickling the edge of his attention. Zach flipped the channel to the hearing, fingers wrapped around a mug of coffee that had long gone cold. He’d declined the invitation to testify, following the advice of his lawyer. The criminal case was nearly over, but the civil suit loomed, unresolved. Still, he knew this hearing wasn’t about finding the truth. Not as he saw Cray’s grandstanding.

“When multiplied across thousands, or millions, of participants, the consequences are catastrophic.” Cray said, his voice rising to a pitch that grated on Zach’s nerves.

Zach shifted on the couch as Roberts announced the speaker. “Next up is the recently appointed Director of Digital Ministry Studies at First Life Church.”

The director walked to the table with a composed solemnity, the kind that came with years of speaking to congregations. Zach’s brow furrowed; he’d heard of this guy before. The man had a reputation for dramatics.

“Members of the committee,” he started, his voice quivering with what Zach immediately recognized as calculated emotion, “this device is nothing less than a tool for dismantling divine order.”

As the First Life Church director began his testimony, Zach’s eyes drifted to the news crawls at the bottom of the screen. The scrolling text felt like a drumbeat, each headline striking deeper than the last:

“NASDAQ halts trading in major tech stocks amid executive departures”

“FBI reports growing several agents ‘unfit for active duty’ after extended leave”

“Major media networks struggling with staff retention crisis”

He sighed, sinking further into his chair. The director’s voice buzzed in the background, righteous and defiant, but Zach couldn’t shake the feeling that the world outside the hearing was far ahead of these debates. They weren’t stopping a storm, they were drowning in it.

Zach’s grip on the remote tightened. The words felt like an invocation, each one laid out to strike chords of fear.

“Could you elaborate on how it separates people from their faith?” Representative Green’s voice was steady, cutting through the theatrics.

“Certainly,” the director said, leaning in as if delivering a sermon. “We’ve documented numerous cases of individuals abandoning their traditional religious practices after using this device. They claim to have ‘seen through’ their previous beliefs, to have found what they call ‘direct experience’ of spiritual truth.” The scorn in his tone was palpable, and Zach’s lips thinned.

“But isn’t that their right under the First Amendment?” Green’s response came swift and pointed, and Zach couldn’t help but nod slightly. At least someone was still asking the tough questions.

Zach’s gaze remained fixed on the screen as the director spoke, each word deliberately chosen to evoke fear. “Of course, but this isn’t a natural spiritual journey guided by proper religious authority. This is a technological shortcut that bypasses traditional paths to salvation. It promises enlightenment without the necessary foundation of faith, without proper spiritual guidance, without…” a pause drew out, “without the divine grace that true spiritual transformation requires.”

Zach felt a twist of frustration coil in his chest. He didn’t know the committee well enough to recognize which members would latch onto such rhetoric. Representative Miller leaned forward, his eyes sharp. “Are you suggesting there’s only one valid path to spiritual truth, director?”

“Not at all,” he responded smoothly, but Zach caught the flicker of hesitation before he continued. “I’m merely pointing out that throughout human history, legitimate spiritual awakening has always come through established religious traditions. Our Lord himself spent forty days in the desert, he didn’t put on a headset for fifteen minutes.”

“Thank you, director,” Roberts said abruptly, impatience seeping into his voice. “I believe we’ve heard enough about theological implications…”

The screen shifted to an attorney at the FTC, hand raised as he was sworn in. Zach reached for the remote and turned up the volume, needing to hear every word.

“Consumer markets are already showing unprecedented shifts. Luxury goods sales have plummeted 60% this quarter. Social media engagement is down 40%. Traditional advertising metrics have become unreliable as enlightened consumers simply stop responding to marketing stimuli.”

Zach’s lips twitched into a half-smile. He remembered the ads that used to light up his screens, gilded watches, sleek cars, vacations to nowhere. They all seemed absurd now, relics of a world that had believed in its own permanence.

Zach’s eyes flicked to the screen, taking in the tension in Cray’s expression as he sat behind the witness table, barely masking his frustration. The attorney’s measured testimony grated on Cray, that much was obvious even without sound. But Zach knew that what bothered Cray most was the FTC’s steady, academic approach. It lacked the fire he craved, the urgency that might incite immediate action.

“We have documented cases of individuals abandoning careers, withdrawing investments, severing economic relationships,” the attorney continued. The words were precise, deliberate, but Zach could sense they lacked the punch Cray wanted. “While these choices may be voluntary, their cumulative effect…”

“Thank you,” Chairman Roberts cut in, his tone brisk.

Zach watched as the director returned to his seat, a subtle smirk flickering across his face. He noted the committee members leaning toward their aides, murmuring. The hearing was meant to steer toward public safety and consumer protection, but the overt sermonizing and sterile testimony of the FTC had muddied the waters. Even Cray’s jaw was set, eyes narrowed, not just at the bias, but likely at the strategic blunder it represented.

The hearing droned on, but Zach’s focus wavered. The crawls, the voices, the endless parsing of consequences, they all blurred together. This wasn’t a debate about the protocol anymore, not really. It was a requiem for a world that no longer existed, even if no one was ready to admit it yet.

=== CHAPTER 44 ===

[SCENE: CH44_S01 | POV: Frank | Location: House Chamber]

Frank O’Hearn leaned forward as Sarah Martinez took the witness chair. He had spent weeks finding the right victims to testify, people whose stories would strike the right chord with the committee members’ constituents. He couldn’t afford to let this moment slip by without impact.

“My husband, Michael, underwent the protocol in December,” Martinez began, dabbing at her eyes. The slight tremor in her voice was perfect. “He’d always been interested in meditation, but this was different. Within days, he’d withdraw all our savings, quit his job, and moved to some kind of commune. Left me alone with our three-year-old daughter…”

Frank’s gaze swept across the room, assessing the reactions. Committee members scribbled notes, their faces a mixture of concern and calculation. Representative Green, who had dismissed the hearings as alarmist earlier, now wore a furrowed brow. That shift meant something; Frank logged it as a potential advantage.

“Did he give any explanation?” Chairman Roberts asked gently, leaning in as though to catch every word.

“He said he’d ‘seen through the illusion’ of our life together,” Martinez replied, her voice cracking at just the right moment. “Said raising our daughter in ‘ignorance’ would be cruel. What kind of father abandons his child for enlightenment?”

Frank felt a grim satisfaction settle in his chest. He had coached her to emphasize the family abandonment angle, ensuring it stung in all the right places. Next, James Wilson would testify, another carefully chosen witness.

“Lost my best chef after fifteen years,” Wilson began, his tone clipped with frustration. “No notice, no explanation. Just said he didn’t need money anymore and walked out mid-shift. Had to close three nights that week. Business still hasn’t recovered…”

Frank’s eyes darted to Chairman Roberts, whose expression tightened.

“And this former employee, have you had any contact with him since?” Roberts asked.

“Found him serving free meals at a homeless shelter,” Wilson scoffed. “Master chef with fifteen years’ experience, feeding soup to junkies. What a waste.”

Frank noted the subtle nods from several committee members. The narrative was taking root as he had envisioned: the protocol as a menace unraveling families, businesses, and social cohesion. Yet, the reality grated on him. Too many of those touched by the protocol were annoyingly difficult to frame as victims. They spoke of joy, fulfillment, and peace—sentiments that threatened to undercut everything he was building.

[SCENE: CH44_S02 | POV: Frank | Location: House Chamber]

“The Committee now recognizes Senator Steven Yost,” Chairman Roberts announced, his tone firm.

Frank’s back straightened. The sudden attention on Yost suggested that someone with real influence was pulling strings behind the scenes. He needed to stay sharp.

“Thank you, Mr. Chairman,” Yost said, his voice deep and commanding, filling the chamber effortlessly. “I’ve listened carefully to today’s testimony about the supposed dangers of this technology. I’ve heard concerns about market disruption, social stability, and religious authority. What I haven’t heard is any recognition of the fundamental American principle that an individual’s spiritual journey is their own.”

Frank’s jaw clenched. This was the narrative he feared, a defense of personal freedom that could chip away at the foundation he had meticulously constructed.

He paused, letting the silence deepen the impact of his words. Frank’s eyes moved across the room, noting the shifting postures of several committee members. The discomfort was unmistakable, and Frank felt the tension tighten in his gut.

“I will admit, in my district alone, three major employers have restructured after key executives went through the protocol. Our largest bank branch operates with a skeleton crew since half their traders simply walked away. The hospital’s entire neurology department has shifted to free community care.” Frank made a fist as the Senator concluded this comment.

“However, also in my district, I’ve met many people who have used the protocol. Yes, some have made dramatic life changes. But isn’t that what spiritual awakening has always done? When someone has a profound religious experience that leads them to join a monastery, we don’t convene congressional hearings. When someone has an epiphany that causes them to change careers and dedicate their life to service, we don’t investigate them for market disruption. The protocol doesn’t appear to be forcing anyone to abandon their roles. It’s opening a door to reimagine them. Perhaps instead of fearing this change, we should be asking how we can support it.”

Frank’s pulse quickened as Representative Green’s expression softened, and he nodded slowly.

“Would you say the government response has been disproportionate, Senator?” Green asked, his voice carrying a tone of genuine curiosity.

Frank’s jaw tensed as he waited for Yost’s response, which came swiftly. “Disproportionate doesn’t begin to cover it,” Yost said, his words resonant and unforgiving. “We’ve had warrantless raids, illegal detentions, evidence fabrication, and what appears to be a coordinated campaign of suppression, all against American citizens exercising their constitutional right to pursue spiritual enlightenment through technological means.”

Frank’s stomach churned. Yost’s accusations threatened to tear down the scaffolding he’d built so carefully. He wanted someone to interject, to push back against the Senator’s momentum.

“But what about the family disruptions?” Representative Miller interrupted, his voice sharp with urgency. “We heard testimony.”

“With respect,” Yost cut in, his tone unwavering, “this committee heard carefully selected anecdotes. I could present dozens of cases where the protocol has strengthened families, improved relationships, and enhanced communities. Mrs. Martinez’s story is tragic, but are we going to ban all spiritual practices because sometimes they lead to divorce? Should we investigate every ashram or monastery because sometimes people leave their jobs to join them?”

Frank’s gaze shifted to Roberts, who was leaning toward an aide, his lips moving in a whispered exchange. The chairman’s furrowed brow suggested he was scrambling to piece together how Yost had managed to slip onto the witness list. Frank’s unease grew; Yost’s words were carving gaping holes in their narrative.

“Mr. Wilson testified about losing an employee,” Green noted, breaking the quiet with a pointed comment. Frank’s fingers tightened around the edge of his notepad. He could sense the shift in the room and knew Green’s question had the potential to swing sympathy.

“But couldn’t one argue that someone choosing to serve the homeless is actually increasing their social contribution?” Green added.

“Exactly,” Yost said, seizing the moment. Frank felt a pulse of frustration throbbing in his temple. The Senator was reframing the narrative effortlessly. “We seem to be defining ‘productive member of society’ solely in terms of economic activity. That’s not only short-sighted, but it’s also fundamentally un-American. Our nation was founded by people seeking spiritual freedom from government control.”

Frank’s breath caught as Yost turned his attention to Cray, the Under Secretary. This was calculated. “Under Secretary, you testified about neural architecture changes. Were any of these changes actually harmful to the individuals involved?”

Cray’s shoulders tensed as he shifted uncomfortably. Frank’s jaw clenched. Cray needed to handle this carefully. “The long-term effects are unknown…”

“That’s not what I asked,” Yost cut in, his voice slicing through the chamber. “Did your testing show any actual harm to the subject?”

Frank’s pulse quickened, willing Cray to regain control of the exchange. “No direct physical harm, but…”

“So, in essence,” Yost pressed on, “federal agents detained an American citizen, subjected them to involuntary medical testing, and found no evidence of harm, all because this person chose to pursue a form of spiritual practice the government doesn’t approve of?”

A murmur rippled through the chamber, and Frank’s eyes darted to the press gallery. Reporters were scribbling furiously, capturing every word. The narrative was slipping, becoming something he could no longer steer.

“The real threat here isn’t to our social fabric,” Yost concluded, his voice dropping to a near whisper that demanded attention. “It’s the precedent we set when we allow government agencies to decide which paths to enlightenment are acceptable. Whether through prayer, meditation, or yes, even technology, the individual’s quest for spiritual truth must remain inviolate. Otherwise, what are we really trying to protect?”

The silence that followed seemed denser than the space itself, pressing down on Frank as he watched Roberts conferring with other committee members. The chairman’s face was drawn, and the tension in his posture spoke volumes. The hearing was slipping beyond the control Frank had so painstakingly orchestrated.

“Counselor,” Representative Green’s voice cut through the room, drawing Frank’s attention back to the exchange, “given Senator Yost’s points about religious freedom, how does the FTC justify treating this as a consumer protection issue?”

Frank’s eyes narrowed as FTC attorney shifted uncomfortably. “Well,” he started, then hesitated, a crack in his confident veneer. “I suppose one could argue that our existing frameworks aren’t really equipped to handle this type of technology…”

Frank suppressed a grimace. It was a weak response, and he knew it. The lines they’d rehearsed were crumbling under the weight of the unexpected debate.

“And director,” Green continued, turning swiftly, “how do you reconcile your calls for government intervention with the First Amendment’s religious protections?”

Frank’s pulse quickened. The director, normally so assured, faltered. “This isn’t a traditional religious practice…”

“Neither was speaking in tongues when it first appeared,” Green interjected. “Should the government have regulated that?”

[SCENE: CH44_S03 | POV: Frank | Location: House Chamber]

Frank felt a chill run down his spine as he watched his carefully built narrative unravel further. Senator Yost’s testimony had turned the tide. Even Wilson and Martinez, whose emotional stories were supposed to anchor the committee’s resolve, now seemed hesitant, their expressions clouded with doubt. Yost’s argument had reframed everything, pulling at the constitutional strings Frank had hoped would remain untouched.

His thoughts strayed to Cray’s testimony and how rapidly it had spiraled. They’d been prepared for scrutiny, for tough questions. But they weren’t ready for ridicule, nor for the momentum to shift so completely. This hearing was supposed to serve as the cornerstone for broader action. Instead, it felt like a referendum on government overreach.

The vibration of his phone jarred him back. He glanced at the screen: a message from an unknown number. “The dharma finds its way.” His fingers tightened instinctively before he deleted it.

The waning afternoon light cast long shadows over the chamber. Roberts called for closing statements, the gavel’s echo resonating in the tense silence. Frank’s hand moved automatically to his phone, typing out a message to his team. They needed to shift to contingency plans, and fast. The protocol slipping from their grasp was no longer a possibility, it was a looming certainty.

As he surveyed the room one last time, his gaze landed on Bud Turner. His former protégé glanced away, but not before Frank caught the look on his face. It wasn’t defiance or challenge, it was pity. That sting cut deeper than he expected.

Roberts brought the session to a close, and the room broke into motion. Frank watched as Cray gathered his papers with robotic precision, Martinez was surrounded by staffers offering quiet consolation, and Wilson spoke animatedly to a cluster of reporters. The elements Frank had so meticulously orchestrated now seemed hollow, stage props in a drama that no longer resonated.

Straightening his tie, he moved toward the exit. Tomorrow’s closed session would tackle enforcement measures, but a part of him already knew it was too late. The words from the deleted message haunted him as he stepped out into the cold February air: The dharma finds its way.

Behind him, the relentless gears of government churned on, processing testimony into policy, tragedy into regulation, fear into law. But deep down, Frank sensed they had unleashed something beyond containment, a force no legislation could leash. He quickened his pace toward the waiting car, the certainty gnawing at him: in their bid to hold the world as it was, they had only hastened its transformation into something new. The last light of day glanced off the Capitol dome, gilding it briefly before giving way to the encroaching dusk.

=== CHAPTER 45 ===

[SCENE: CH45_S01 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

Cray’s footsteps echoed down the empty hallway, sharp and uneven against the polished marble floor, each tap seeming to underscore the distance from everything familiar. He paused outside his office door, listening as the murmur of aides and lobbyists seeped faintly through the thick oak.

His hand hovered over the brass handle, fingers twitching with the same tremor that had plagued him for days. He pressed them hard into his palm, trying to force the shaking into submission, but it continued.

Pushing the door open, he slipped inside, where the muted hum of the city filtered through the tall windows behind his desk. The office was spotless, every document and file in place with his characteristic precision. Yet, as his gaze passed over the familiar details, they felt foreign.

Cray moved to the window, peering down at the streets below. Cars inched forward like ants, headlights barely cutting through the encroaching dusk. He used to savor this view, the sense of command it gave him, the knowledge that every decision he made reverberated through the lives of those below. But today, the city felt distant, as though slipping beyond his grasp. For the first time, the height didn’t empower him; it reminded him of his own fragility.

He placed his hand on the windowpane, the cool glass anchoring him momentarily. Exhaling, he watched his breath cloud the surface, then swiped it away with his sleeve, the motion automatic. His phone buzzed in his pocket. Likely O’Hearn, persistent as ever, but he ignored it. Instead, his fingers found a hairline crack in the glass, something he hadn’t noticed before. Pressing his fingertips against it, he tested its strength, noting how it held firm but remained undeniably present.

Just like everything else in his life, Cray thought. Cracked, but enduring.

Turning from the window, he crossed the room with a stiffness that felt foreign, each step mechanical. When he reached his desk, his eyes caught on the half-open drawer, where a photo peeked from beneath a stack of briefing papers. He hadn’t looked at it in months, but today, he pulled it free.

The photograph was worn, its edges frayed from years of handling. His wife’s face beamed up at him, their daughter perched on her hip, her eyes alive with a future he’d once worked tirelessly to protect. He traced his thumb over his wife’s face, his hand trembling. He’d sacrificed for them, long nights, endless meetings, and compromised more times than he cared to remember. But that smile, like the people in the picture, belonged to another time.

He set the photo face down on the desk, fixing his gaze on it, waiting for something to rise within him, guilt, anger, regret. But only silence came, the same unyielding silence that had filled the Senate chamber that morning as his words fell into the void.

The committee listened with the practiced politeness of seasoned politicians, nodding in all the right places. But Cray saw it in their eyes, the hesitation, the creeping doubt. And then came the final blow: Senator Yost’s offhanded suggestion to investigate the “potential benefits” of the protocol. The phrase slipped out so easily, but it hit Cray like a gut punch. They were slipping. The tide was turning, and he was powerless to stop it.

[SCENE: CH45_S02 | POV: Lawrence | Location: Lawrence's Office]

His hand steadied as he pressed the call button. The phone rang once, twice, before O’Hearn’s voice buzzed through the speaker.

“We’re going to war, O’Hearn,” Cray said, his tone low and deliberate. “No more half-measures. I want the protocol shut down, by any means necessary.”

O’Hearn’s response hummed in his ear, a blur of words he barely registered. Cray’s gaze was fixed on the window, the city beyond reduced to a mesh of lights and motion. He wasn’t part of it anymore, not in the way he once was. He’d become something different, hardened, colder.

He ended the call and set the phone down on the desk, its presence stark beside the face-down photograph. His fingers brushed the edge of the worn frame, but he didn’t turn it over. There was no need. He wasn’t fighting for them anymore, he was fighting for humanity.

Outside, the sky deepened, and the city lights flickered like distant stars. Cray stared at them, catching a faint glimpse of his reflection fractured by the crack in the glass, and let the silence close in around him.

=== CHAPTER 46 ===

[SCENE: CH46_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Courthouse]

Zach stood in the marble halls of the federal courthouse, its towering architecture above him. He watched anxious people rush by with their attorneys, papers clutched tightly, their whispers barely reaching his ears.

Beside him, Christine Torres stood with a poise that defied the tension in the air.

“They’ll drop the charges,” she said, glancing at her watch as if this were routine. “They have to.”

“Have to?” Zach echoed, his voice tinged with doubt.

Torres’s smile was thin, almost imperceptible. “Let’s just say their evidence has some… interesting anomalies. Timestamps that don’t match server logs, access records created after the fact, the kind of mistakes made in a rush to build a case.”

Before Zach could ask more, a young, ambitious-looking prosecutor strode over, his eyes averted, his movement slow. “Ms. Torres, Mr. Goodman.”

“Martin.” Torres’s nod was brisk. “I trust you’ve reviewed our motion?”

“We have.” The prosecutor shifted uneasily, his eyes flicking down the hall toward the U.S. Attorney’s offices. “In light of certain evidentiary… concerns, along with the fact that some of our staff have disappeared, the government is moving to dismiss all charges.”

“With prejudice,” Torres said, her tone leaving no room for negotiation.

The prosecutor’s jaw tightened. “Yes. With prejudice.”

“Excellent,” Torres said smoothly. “We’ll see the judge now?”

The proceedings in the courtroom took less than five minutes. Zach noticed the judge’s eyebrow lift at the words “with prejudice,” but he signed the order without a word.

Outside the courtroom, Zach turned to Torres. “That seemed… easy.”

“Good lawyers make it look easy,” she said, slipping the dismissal order into her briefcase. “Ms. Sato chose her team well.”

 “The civil suit will drag on, but this was their best shot. They wanted to paint you as a criminal, and they failed.” Torres smiled, a rare softness. “Sometimes that’s all people need to see.”

Zach watched her stride away, thoughts swirling around evidence that seemed too perfect, corporate leaders who were too confident, and federal agents who acted too fast. The criminal case was over, but a gnawing sense told him his real fight was just beginning.

=== CHAPTER 47 ===

[SCENE: CH47_S01 | POV: Guy | Location: Guy's Car]

Guy Whitman adjusted the focus on his binoculars, eyes narrowing as students trickled into the rundown inner-city school. Six hours of surveillance and still no sign of possible protocol distribution. The routine churned in his head, but there was something else, a feeling gnawing at the back of his mind that he couldn’t quite shake.

A man stepped out of the building, commanding attention even among the mundane flow of students. Marcus Foreman. Whitman’s pulse quickened. He had read the file cover to cover: former Special Forces, decorated combat veteran. Yet none of the paperwork had prepared him for the unsettling composure with which Foreman moved. The precision, the unbothered calm, it made the hairs on Whitman’s neck stand on end.

Foreman stopped abruptly. Whitman’s chest tightened as Foreman’s gaze locked in his direction. Concealment and distance suddenly felt irrelevant, as if the barrier between them had dissolved. The subtle nod Foreman gave only cemented the feeling. Whitman forced himself to breathe.

[SCENE: CH47_S02 | POV: Guy | Location: School]

Fifteen minutes later, Whitman sat in Foreman’s classroom, the chalk dust mingling with the metallic tang of anticipation. The unnatural order of the space struck him; a classroom in this neighborhood shouldn’t be this immaculate. He scanned the room again, gang tags scrawled outside the window, glaring through the glass like specters of the life outside.

“You were Force Recon,” Foreman stated, breaking the silence. His tone was flat, assured.

Whitman’s jaw clenched. “How did you…”

“The way you set up observation.” Foreman’s voice carried the weight of shared history, one soldier reading another. “Classic Marine approach. I used to do the same.”

Whitman’s eyes narrowed, searching for any sign of deception. “Used to,” he repeated, letting the word hang like an accusation. “Before you used the protocol. I know this is a distribution point, Foreman.”

A flicker of something unreadable crossed Foreman’s face. “Sadly, you have been misinformed.” He gestured around the room, the smooth motion somehow disarming. “Sometimes a school is only a school.”

Whitman’s patience snapped. “Some school,” he said, his voice cutting like a blade. “I read the reports.. Fewer discipline issues. Better attendance. Grades are all over the place though.”

“They’re learning there’s another way to…”

“To what?” Whitman’s tone dripped with disdain. “Surrender? Is that what you learned in the Corps?” He stood, the chair scraping against the floor with a harsh squeal. “America wasn’t built on acceptance. It was built on competition, on never backing down.”

Foreman’s expression remained infuriatingly calm, the quiet reproach clear in his eyes. “And how’s that working out?” he asked, voice low but resonant. “These kids have seen more violence than we did in combat. They don’t need more warriors. They need…”

“They need to know how to survive in the real world,” Whitman shot back, fists clenching at his sides. “Not this… spiritual bypass.”

A faint smile tugged at the corner of Foreman’s mouth. Whitman’s hand twitched, an instinctive reaction to an enemy’s provocation.

“Where is your headset?” Whitman’s voice dropped, sharp and insistent. “The one you used to turn yourself into this,” He spat the words, unable to find an insult biting enough. It wouldn’t matter; it would roll off Foreman’s disciplined demeanor. “Did you give it to one of these kids?”

“No, I did not,” Foreman replied, his calmness unwavering, needling at Whitman’s simmering anger. “You know it wouldn’t work for them. It was the only one I’ve ever seen, and it’s been passed on. To another adult interested in ending their suffering.”

Whitman took a step toward the door, the weight of frustration anchoring each movement. He paused, a parting shot clawing its way up his throat. “You were a Marine. You took an oath.”

“I still serve,” Foreman said, almost too softly. “I just don’t serve fear anymore.”

Whitman’s teeth ground together as he forced himself to leave, shutting the door behind him with more force than he intended. So much for finding a protocol distribution point or leads onto the whereabouts of Sato, or if another manufacturing facility had started up.

[SCENE: CH47_S03 | POV: Marcus | Location: School]

The door clicked shut, and the echo of Guy Whitman’s footsteps dissolved into the silence of the hallway. Marcus remained still, his hands resting on the desk, his breath steady. The classroom exhaled with him, a subtle creak in the floorboards, the soft hum of the air conditioning. It was all part of the same pulse, the same rhythm, as natural and inevitable as waves meeting the shore.

The desk beneath his palms seemed alive, not in any mystical sense, but in the way its grain carried the memory of the tree it once was. He felt the sunlight filtering through the window, not as warmth on his skin but as light itself, ancient and infinite, crossing countless miles to be here, now. The chalk dust in the air swirled lazily, each speck a galaxy in its own right, its path shaped by imperceptible eddies of air. Everything was as it should be.

Guy’s question still hung in the room, more persistent than his footsteps: “If everyone can be everything, how do we know who we are?”

Marcus had let the question sit, knowing it didn’t need an answer. He could have said, “You are the answer.” He could have pointed to the sunlight or the desk or the dust and shown him that the question itself was a kind of forgetting. But words were a closed loop, and enlightenment was the breaking of all loops.

The paper on the desk fluttered faintly in the breeze from the vent. Marcus watched it settle again, its stillness a kind of peace. The moment was everything: the weight of the air, the shifting light, the memory of Guy’s frustration carried away like vapor. Marcus felt it all without grasping, without dividing. To be enlightened wasn’t to transcend, it was to include. To hold the entire universe in the curve of a single breath.

He rose, his movement seamless with the room. The doorframe was cool under his hand, its grain a mirror of the desk’s, a quiet echo of the tree it had been. He thought of Guy and the urgency behind his questions, the desperation to know, to define, to contain. There would be time for answers, or better, for silence, but not yet. Not now.

For now, Marcus stood in the stillness and smiled, feeling the classroom hold him as gently as he held it, one seamless whole.

=== CHAPTER 48 ===

[SCENE: CH48_S01 | POV: Frank | Location: Frank's Office]

Frank O’Hearn read the Goodman decision for the third time, each word tightening his jaw further. The lines taunted him, cold and sharp: fabricate evidence of wrongdoing injurious to the reputation and future employability of the claimant.

He slammed the document onto his desk, the sound echoing through the quiet office, and strode to the window to gather his thoughts. He could already envision the Board’s restless eyes searching for a scapegoat. Despite his best efforts to stall the inevitable, an emergency meeting loomed on the horizon, and his meticulously crafted case against the protocol was unraveling faster than he could mend the breaches.

The intercom buzzed, breaking the silence. “Mr. Whitman is here to see you, sir.”

Frank’s gaze stayed on the city skyline. “Send him in.”

The door opened, and Guy Whitman stepped in without a sound. Even in retirement, the man exuded the disciplined presence of a soldier. Frank had appointed him as head of his personal security just weeks earlier, a decision he now felt vindicated in as the Board’s anger mounted.

“I believe I’m going to be relieved of my chairmanship this evening,” Frank said, not bothering with formalities. “Possibly removed from the Board entirely.”

Whitman stood motionless, a slight twitch at the corner of his mouth betraying his reaction. “I’d heard as much. Their loss. Is there even a workforce left to chair over?”

Frank turned, meeting Whitman’s steady gaze. “Who knows? It will, at least, allow me to focus on other matters. The protocol issue won’t solve itself. This isn’t going away, this is going to continue to eat at society.”

Whitman’s eyes narrowed. “That son of a bitch Goodman up to something?”

Frank shook his head slightly. “Goodman, Mulvaney, Sato, take your pick. Too much silence from all three.”

“Mulvaney’s been quiet for a reason,” Whitman said, a dark chuckle underlining his words.

Frank’s lips pressed into a thin line. “And the FBI let him go yesterday.” He saw Whitman’s eyebrows lift, the soldier’s composed demeanor giving way to a flicker of surprise. “Makes you wonder who’s really pulling strings at the Bureau.”

“Think the administration’s trying to cover themselves now that they’re shoving this under the rug?” Whitman asked, eyes sharpening.

“Likely.” Frank moved behind his desk, his fingers brushing over a stack of papers before pulling out a thick file. “And we both know what festers under rugs when garbage is swept there.” He handed Whitman the file, a dossier thick with surveillance updates. “Trout and Cray’s latest. Details on Goodman’s behavior, Mulvaney’s movements, and the ongoing search for Sato. Goodman’s been holed up at home, playing video games, of all things, while waiting for his civil case to resolve. Now that it’s gone in his favor, he’ll make a move. I can feel it.”

Whitman nodded, eyes scanning the cover of the file as if weighing its contents. “Where do you want me to start?”

“Goodman. You know where he lives.” Frank’s voice was clipped, a directive. “But the priority is finding proof that production is starting up again.”

Whitman’s gaze met his. “The Sato property?”

“Jeta’s Grove. Something never sat right about those searches,” Frank muttered, drumming his fingers on the desk. The place was vast, acres of dense woodland. He doubted anyone had scoured it thoroughly. “Without federal backing, we’ll need to be creative about getting access. But it’s worth pursuing.”

“It will be my pleasure,” Whitman said, a resolute glint in his eyes as he turned for the door. Frank noted the tension in the man’s jaw, a flicker of remembered enmity there. Whitman had never spoken of it, but Frank had sensed it, the way Foreman’s serene smile haunted him, embodying everything they both needed to dismantle. “We need to stop this before it spreads any further.”

Whitman’s lips twitched into a smirk. “About damn time.” The door closed softly behind him, leaving the room in a heavy silence.

[SCENE: CH48_S02 | POV: Frank | Location: Frank's Office]

Alone once more, Frank slumped into his chair, a long, tired breath escaping him. His gaze drifted to the framed photo on the edge of the desk. A trip to Ireland, years past, flashed before him, the Cliffs of Moher towering in the background, wind whipping at their clothes. His wife stood with one hand clutching her hat, their children doubled over in laughter as the hat soared away, swallowed by the cliff’s edge, and lost to the sky. The memory played like a warm current, and for a brief moment, it dulled the sharp tension coiled inside him.

He brushed his fingertips over the glass, a faint smile fading as quickly as it came. This was what he was truly fighting for. Not the chairmanship, not the recognition that came with it, but a future in which his children could grow up unburdened by the allure of synthetic enlightenment, a world where they would strive, stumble, and succeed on their own terms.

His jaw clenched as he shifted his thoughts to the hearings. The congressional spectacle had failed to stir the public outrage he had anticipated.

Frank’s mind turned to his last conversation with Cray. He was one of the few allies left, someone who understood what they were up against.

Trout was beginning to cool off now that the political winds had shifted. Even the reverend and the director, still useful but too preoccupied with the religious angle, were missing the bigger picture. None of them grasped the true magnitude of what was at stake.

Let the Board strip him of his chairmanship. He didn’t need it. The private sector had always been more adept at confronting threats that the government either couldn’t or wouldn’t face. All he required now was irrefutable proof that production was restarting, something tangible enough for Cray to leverage into real action at Homeland Security.

A soft chime from his computer signaled the reminder for the Board meeting. Frank tugged at his tie, adjusting it with the precision of a soldier readying for battle. If they believed that ousting him would put an end to his crusade, they were about to learn just how mistaken they were.

His eyes fell one last time on the family photo. The memory of the wind snatching his wife’s hat flashed through his mind, but with it came the sound of her laughter, carefree and resilient, already imagining a better one to replace it. The loss had been fleeting, a reminder that when something was taken, it simply meant finding another way forward.

Frank squared his shoulders as he moved to the office door. The Board was waiting. They could strip him of his title, but they couldn’t stop what was coming.

=== CHAPTER 49 ===

[SCENE: CH49_S01 | POV: Gwen | Location: Gwen's Office]

The sterile blue light of the office flickered faintly as Gwen Trout stared at the brain scans glowing on her monitor. Neural pathways shimmered with clean precision; each illuminated connection spoke to her with an unwelcome truth: the protocol had altered something fundamental. But it wasn’t the kind of alteration she had anticipated. No visible harm. No trauma. Just the cold, clinical language of enhanced cognitive flexibility and improved emotional regulation. The terms rang hollow in her mind, stripped of the urgency they should have held.

Trout pressed her fingers to her temples, feeling the dull ache from too many sleepless nights. Containment had been her life’s work, keeping dangerous technologies tightly controlled. Now, the data in front of her seemed to mock that effort to find harm, the creeping realization settling in her gut like a stone. The protocol had outpaced their safeguards, slipping through the regulatory net she’d spent years constructing, unraveling it thread by thread.

The soft creak of the door jarred her from her thoughts. She glanced over as one of her researchers stepped into the room. He hesitated, and she caught the flicker of uncertainty before he spoke.

“They’re saying Cray’s pushing harder now. Legal measures, sanctions, anything he can throw at the protocol,” the assistant said, his voice faltering. “But… he doesn’t appear to be slowing it down, does he?”

The words settled heavily between them. She reached out and flicked off the monitor, casting the room in cold, muted darkness. “No,” she said, her voice soft, almost resigned. “He’s not.”

Stepping closer, his searching gaze in the dim light, as if he expected her to provide answers she no longer had, he spoke, “How did we let it get this far? We had the mechanisms in place, the regulations, the oversight. We should have been able to stop this before it spread.”

A sharp pang of guilt cut through her. “I thought we could,” she admitted, fingers curling tightly together to keep them from trembling. She focused on her hands, willing herself to appear composed. “I thought the system was strong enough. That if we just filed the right reports, used the right levers of control… we could stop it. But it’s moving faster than we can.”

The assistant collapsed into the chair across from her, his frame sagging under the weight of his unspoken fear. “We testified before Congress. We told them the protocol was dangerous, a threat. But they didn’t listen.” His head shook slowly, haunted by memories she could only guess at.

Trout turned abruptly, the movement propelled by frustration and a desperate need for motion. The city lights outside flickered like distant, indifferent stars, oblivious to the chaos unfolding within her world. “This isn’t what was supposed to happen,” she whispered, more to herself than to him. “The system was supposed to protect us from things like this. It wasn’t supposed to fall apart.”

The silence in the room thickened, broken only by the distant hum of traffic outside. Trout pressed her hand against the cool glass, her breath fogging its surface as she stared at the cityscape blurred by the glow of streetlights. The belief that the right rules and oversight could protect the world from the unknown had defined her career. But now, with the protocol spreading like wildfire, even that certainty felt like a lie.

“What do we do now?” the assistant’s voice, brittle and hesitant, cut through the silence. “What’s left for us?”

Trout’s hand dropped from the window, her shoulders slumping under the weight of everything she couldn’t articulate. She turned to face him, meeting his gaze with eyes shadowed by exhaustion and doubt. “I don’t know.”

The words settled heavily in the room. The assistant sat in stunned silence, head bowed, but his lips moved with no sound. Trout moved across the room and sat beside him, the chair creaking as she leaned forward. “We could try to delay it,” she said, her voice low and flat, each word tasting of defeat. “Make them jump through hoops, slow the process, buy time. But even that feels… pointless.”

 “Delay it for what? Another year? Another month? What’s the point, Gwen, if we can’t stop it?”

Her fingers dug into her palms, the sting was a reminder of her helplessness. She wanted to offer hope, to say that there was still a chance that they could turn the tide. But the words stuck in her throat. Because deep down, she wasn’t sure she believed it anymore.

“We keep going,” she said finally, though the resolve in her voice was paper thin. “We do what we can… until we can’t anymore.”

The assistant nodded, the movement weak and resigned. When he stood, his movements were slow, deliberate. Trout’s gaze followed him, a mix of pity and understanding churning inside her. They were both caught in this spiral, playing a game they were destined to lose, trying to hold back the inevitable.

[SCENE: CH49_S02 | POV: Gwen | Location: Gwen's Office]

The door clicked shut, leaving Trout alone with the dim glow of her monitor and the suffocating awareness of her wavering beliefs. The silence settled back in, pressing down on her as she turned to her desk.

She opened the newspaper, its headline glaring up at her like an accusation. “Protocol Users Report Unprecedented Drop in Antidepressant Use,” it read. Her eyes skimmed the lines, the clinical detachment slipping as she took in the implications. “FDA data shows a 47% decrease in psychiatric medication use among confirmed protocol users. ‘The brain scans are undeniable,’ admits Dr. Sarah Martinez of the National Institute of Mental Health. ‘We’re seeing lasting improvements in emotional regulation and stress response that no current medication can match.’”

The report blurred before her tired eyes, a sharp reminder of the shifting world that was leaving her, and everything she had built, behind.

=== CHAPTER 50 ===

[SCENE: CH50_S01 | POV: Constance | Location: Constance's Office]

Constance Henning sat in her office, rubbing her temples. The city outside her window thrummed with life, oblivious to the quiet, simmering disintegration happening within the walls of power. A notification buzzed on her phone, flashing an insistent demand, another press inquiry, another plea for her take on the unfolding crisis. She ignored it, letting the device vibrate in silence.

Let them all clamor, she thought. Soon enough, they’d be shouting into the void.

Her gaze fixed on the cluster of screens displaying live updates from across the nation. Red alerts blinked in unison, a mockery of the precision she’d built her career around. Control was slipping, not in bursts, but in a slow, insidious erosion.

It wasn’t just the start of breakdowns in infrastructure. The systems themselves, designed to govern, enforce, and respond, would soon lose their grip on the people who once upheld them. The country could be facing critical shortages in law enforcement soon with officers on extended leave. Precincts were filing requests for de-escalation training instead of riot gear, commanders starting to openly question their directives. Even the firewalls designed to filter protocol-related behaviors had begun to degrade, as enlightened IT teams re-prioritized their efforts toward public access and transparency.

[SCENE: CH50_S02 | POV: Constance | Location: Constance's Office]

The sound of her office door creaking open drew her gaze. The FTC attorney, whose steady hand had guided more than a few covert maneuvers in Washington, stepped in. His movements were deliberate, his expression unreadable as he closed the door behind him and spared a glance at the muted news broadcast flickering on the wall-mounted screen.

“Ms. Henning,” he said, his voice low and controlled. “I know you’ve seen the latest. Cray’s pushing hard. O’Hearn’s scrambling.”

Constance leaned back in her chair, staring at the muted hum of the monitors lining her office wall. The gentle whir of the air conditioning seemed louder than it should, filling the silence left by reports she no longer had the energy to review.

Henning folded her hands in her lap, allowing the faintest trace of a smile to ghost across her lips. “Of course they are. That’s what people do when they feel the ground slipping beneath them. Do you know what this room used to feel like?” she asked, her voice low and more rhetorical than curious. “Every time I walked in here, I thought, ‘This is where we keep the chaos at bay.’ And now? Now, I look at these screens and think, ‘This is where we try to convince ourselves the chaos is still out there.’ But it’s not. It’s in here.”

The attorney hovered a few paces from her desk, his posture tense, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. Henning caught the hesitation and gestured toward the chair across from her. He accepted the invitation, settling into the chair with a sigh that hinted at exhaustion.

“Cray’s team just submitted a new legal strategy to counter the protocol’s spread,” he continued, leaning forward. “Sanctions, regulatory blockades, all sorts of legal wrangling. He’s throwing everything at it.”

Henning’s gaze remained fixed on him, her voice soft, almost bemused. “And how’s that going for him?”

A beat passed, and the lawyer’s frown deepened. “Not well. The committee’s confidence is unraveling, and momentum’s shifting in favor of the protocol. Public opinion is… complicated.”

Henning leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as they met his. The familiar spark of insight danced behind her composed exterior. “The more desperate the fight, the clearer it becomes who has already lost.”

The attorney uncharacteristically shifted uncomfortably, the creak of leather breaking the silence. His brows furrowed as he studied her, searching for a hint of doubt. “You sound like you’ve already written them off.”

Her smile widened, cold and knowing. “I don’t need to write them off. They’re doing it themselves. Take your own department, for example,” Constance continued, her tone soft but deliberate. “How many agents do you have left for consumer protection enforcement?”

The attorney hesitated, as if weighing the value of candor. “Not enough,” she admitted finally. “Ten percent of our staff is technically on leave. The other half… they’re there, but they’re not. Most of them refuse to pursue cases that don’t align with their personal values anymore. They say they can’t, in good conscience, penalize people for surviving.”

Constance nodded grimly. “And it’s not just your department. Treasury analysts aren’t analyzing. IRS auditors won’t audit. Even at Justice, prosecutors are walking away from cases.” Her gaze dropped to her desk, where a half-filled coffee mug sat beside a stack of unread briefs. “It’s not active resistance. It’s… detachment. The kind you can’t fight because there’s nothing to push against.”

The lawyer exhaled, his fingers drumming a restless pattern on the armrest. “They’re pushing hard, Constance. If Cray gets enough traction with these legal proposals, they might slow this down. Maybe even stall it indefinitely.”

Henning’s eyes narrowed slightly as she studied him, assessing the depth behind his statement. “And you think that’s possible? Stalling this indefinitely?”

A shadow of doubt flickered across the attorney’s features before he replied. “No. Not indefinitely. But maybe long enough to put a serious dent in its momentum.”

Henning’s gaze didn’t waver, her voice steady and almost conversational. “And what happens then? When they’ve exhausted their resources and their reputations? When they finally realize this,” she made a dismissive gesture with her hand, “isn’t something they can contain?”

Shoulders tightening as he shifted, his eyes drifting toward the window where the sun was dipping below the skyline, casting a deepening glow over the city, the attorney replied, “You think they’re losing steam?”

“I think,” Henning said, reclining back into her chair with deliberate ease, “they’re too focused on the short game. Cray’s obsession with maintaining control, O’Hearn’s desperation to protect his legacy, the reverend’s misguided spiritual crusade… They’re all playing to win a battle that’s already lost.”

His expression grew more guarded as he met her eyes, searching for the intention beneath her words. “And you? What are you playing for?”

Henning let the silence between them expand, savoring its weight before answered. “I’m not playing to win this round. I’m playing to shape what comes next.”

Brows drawing together, a flicker of wariness deepening his stare, he leaned forward. “What exactly do you mean by that?”

Her lips curved into a more thoughtful smile. “The protocol is out there, spreading faster than they can hope to contain. Fighting it head-on, like Cray and O’Hearn? It’s a battle already lost. But guiding it, steering its evolution?” She paused, allowing the full implication to sink in. “That’s the real power. The only kind that matters.”

The attorney leaned back, processing her words with a thoughtful frown. “You’re talking about… influencing how it’s used? Regulating its growth?”

Henning’s expression sharpened with approval. “Exactly. Let them exhaust themselves trying to kill it. When they fail, the world will need someone who understands it, who knows how to integrate it without letting it spiral out of control. We need to be that someone.”

A knowing edge colored the lawyer’s next question. “And you think that someone is you?” He already knew the answer.

“I don’t think,” Henning said, her voice ironclad. “I know. Cray and the others are chained to their archaic visions of control. They want to suppress it, destroy it. But the future can’t be suppressed. It can only be shaped. And when the chaos settles, we’ll be the ones holding the reins.”

The lawyer’s eyes narrowed as he studied Constance, she could tell he was weighing her intent. He had obviously witnessed power plays before, but her strategy was probably unlike any he’d seen, subtle, patient, relentless. She wasn’t trying to win the crowd or headline. She was positioning herself to last.

“And where does that leave me?” His voice was measured, cautious.

Henning’s gaze pierced him, appraising. “That depends on you. The FTC will be crucial in the coming years as the protocol weaves its way further into society. There will be regulatory frameworks to construct, legislation to steer. I need people who understand the long game, who know when to strike and when to bide their time.”

The room’s atmosphere shifted as both turned their attention to the television. The announcer’s urgent tone cut through the quiet: “Breaking News from Washington: leaked documents reveal that several government officials have used the controversial new technology known as the karmic protocol. Internal memos obtained by this network suggest that even high-ranking federal officials, who have publicly opposed the protocol, have secretly undergone the process. Sources indicate that the number of enlightened government employees could be in the hundreds…”

The attorney stood, his movements composed as he adjusted his tie, the gears in his mind clearly turning.

Just as he turned to leave, Henning’s voice called him back, low but commanding. “Remember: those who survive aren’t always the ones who fight the hardest. They’re the ones who know when to let others burn out.”

He paused at the doorway, meeting her eyes. A silent understanding passed between them, and with a slight nod, he stepped into the corridor.

Henning leaned back in her chair, eyes drifting to the cityscape where the first specks of light blinked awake in the twilight. Cray, O’Hearn, they were all too loud, too exposed. They would burn themselves out, frenzied and spent. And when they did, she would still be there, biding her time, waiting to step forward from the shadows.

=== CHAPTER 51 ===

[SCENE: CH51_S01 | POV: Fiona | Location: Christine's Office]

Fiona Gile sat in Christine Torres’ office, tension simmering beneath her composed exterior. The silence between them stretched thin, taut with the anticipation of the agent’s unspoken questions. Torres hadn’t flinched when she arrived. She’d simply motioned her to the chair across from her desk and continued reading her documents, as if a federal agent dropping by unannounced was an everyday occurrence.

“Ms. Torres,” Gile said, breaking the silence. “We need to locate Georgia Sato.”

She watched Torres’ reaction closely. Her eyes lifted, calm and detached. “And you think I can help with that?”

Gile leaned forward, her tone firm. “You represented Zach Goodman. Sato hired you. Given recent developments, we have reason to believe…”

“That I’m somehow tracking the movements of a former client’s associate?” Torres set her pen down with a deliberate click. Her voice was sharp. “Or are you hoping I’ll breach attorney-client privilege?”

“We’re trying to prevent further manufacture of these devices,” Gile said, noticing the slight hesitation in her own voice. The conviction that usually underscored her words was absent, replaced by something more uncertain.

“Are you?” Torres’ eyes narrowed, the veneer of professionalism slipping just enough to reveal an edge of personal concern. “My sister went through the protocol six months ago.”

A chill swept through Gile. This was not the turn she’d expected.

“She was a corporate litigator,” Torres continued, her voice tightening with emotion. “Eighty-hour weeks, two divorces, addiction issues she managed to conceal well enough to keep her partnership. The kind of person you’d assume would abandon everything after enlightenment, wouldn’t you?”

Gile cleared his throat. “Did she abandon everything?”

Torres’ expression softened, a faint, almost wistful smile appearing. “She still practices law. Still puts in the same grueling hours. But now? Her clients actually listen to her. She helps them see solutions they were too blinded by fear and greed to notice before. Her billable hours are down, but her success rate is off the charts.”

Gile’s stomach tightened. This was not what Cray would want to hear. “That’s… interesting,” she said, choosing her words carefully.

Gile let the silence sit for a moment before pushing herself to her feet, needing to end the conversation. “But not relevant to my investigation. Thank you for your time, Ms. Torres.”

[SCENE: CH51_S02 | POV: Fiona | Location: Fiona's Car]

In the car, Gile gripped the steering wheel, staring out the window. The city blurred by, an indifferent backdrop to their thoughts. She rang her partner.

“What do we put in the report?” he finally asked after getting filled in, his voice low.

“That Torres was uncooperative,” Gile replied, the words sharp and practiced. “No actionable intelligence.”

A brief moment of silence finally ended when he asked. “And the sister?”

Gile started the engine, jaw set. “What sister? That conversation didn’t happen.”

Gile could sense the unspoken agreement, the silent understanding between them. It was a risk, an omission that could come back to haunt them. Cray would still demand answers, still press them to find Sato so they could dismantle the protocol’s spread. But for now, this was all they could offer: a moment of quiet defiance in a storm of expectations.

As she pulled away from the curb, her partner’s voice broke the silence. “We could probably justify scaling back surveillance on the tech sector. Say resources are better spent elsewhere.”

Gile’s grip on the wheel relaxed, ever so slightly. “Could do. Lot of other cases need attention.”

It wasn’t redemption. Not even resistance, not really. But as she drove back to report another dead end, a subtle shift settled in. Not enlightenment, Gile knew she wasn’t anywhere close to that. But after hearing the story of Torres’ sister, maybe, just maybe, the first glimmer of doubt.

[SCENE: CH51_S03 | POV: Elana | Location: Conference Room]

Across town another conference room was empty now, save for Christine Torres’ sister, who sat alone at the long glass table. The surface was immaculate, reflecting the stark fluorescents overhead like a still pool. She traced the edge of the table absently, her fingertips brushing over its cold precision.

Her colleagues had left minutes ago, carrying with them the fragments of a settlement deal that had hung in the air like smoke. To them, it was a triumph, a careful dance of concessions and demands. Elena had smiled as they shook hands, nodded at the appropriate moments, and signed her name at the bottom of the page. None of it was false, but none of it truly mattered either. The protocol had unraveled her need to win, reframed what winning meant.

Elena closed her eyes and let her breathing slow, the stillness of the room expanding around her. The silence wasn’t empty. It was alive, humming faintly with the trace vibrations of all that had passed here. The click of pens, the shuffle of papers, the slight catch in a junior associate’s voice as he delivered a point too rehearsed. Even the tension in the opposing counsel’s jaw, she could still feel it, not as a memory but as something shared, a ripple that passed through them both and faded, like a wave returning to the ocean.

This was the essence of her work now, stripped of the illusions she once clung to. There were no adversaries, no competitors, no “other.” Every argument she made, every brief she wrote, every case she fought, it was all one motion, one story, part of a whole so vast and intricate it defied comprehension. She wasn’t here to dismantle or defeat; she was here to balance. Justice, she realized, wasn’t a scale, it was a river, and she was simply one of its currents.

Her phone buzzed on the table, and she opened her eyes, her hand moving instinctively to silence it. The screen showed a name she recognized but didn’t cling to. Another point of connection, neither more nor less important than the hum of the air conditioning or the faint smudge on the table’s surface.

She stood, smoothing the lines of her blazer, and glanced at the skyline beyond the window. The city stretched out before her, a labyrinth of steel and glass and movement, all of it pulsing with its own rhythm. She could feel it, the countless lives intertwining, each decision rippling outward like light through crystal. Six months ago, she would have seen it as a challenge, something to master and control. Now, it was simply beautiful.

She turned off the lights as she left, the room slipping into darkness behind her. Outside, the city waited, and Elena walked toward it not as a litigator, not as a woman, but as a part of its vast and endless flow. Tomorrow she would practice law in her own way.

=== CHAPTER 52 ===

[SCENE: CH52_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Zach's House]

Tim stood outside Zach’s door, fighting off the exhaustion that threatened to pull him under. His heart pounded, reminding of the miles and moments that had led him here. He pressed the doorbell, hearing the faint chime echo within.

Inside, Zach paced the narrow hallway of his home, his mind a tangle of contradictions. Every glance at the unopened mail on the counter felt like a confrontation he wasn’t ready for. The faint chime of the doorbell pulled him from his spiral, a sound both mundane and ominous.

Zach’s startled face appeared in the narrow window beside the door. Tim could almost see the flood of emotions ripple across his friend’s features, disbelief, confusion, fear. A second later, the door swung open, and Zach yanked him inside, his eyes darting to the street before he shut the door with a snap.

“What in the hell?” Zach’s voice quivered slightly, though he tried to mask it.

Tim met Zach’s wide-eyed stare, his own exhaustion seeping through. “What in the hell, indeed,” he muttered, shuffling further into the house. His clothes felt grimy, the scent of days-old sweat clinging to him like a bad memory.

Zach’s eyes narrowed, scanning him up and down. “What happened to you?” he asked, guiding Tim toward the living room.

Tim sank into the familiar couch, its worn cushions barely soft enough to comfort. He let out a long, ragged sigh. “What didn’t happen to me?” The words felt bitter in his mouth. “I went to find Georgia, didn’t find her, and that little window of time was all they needed to pick me up at the docks.”

Zach paled. “Who picked you up?” His voice dropped to a whisper, the room’s air thickening with shared tension.

“Our friends at Homeland Security,” Tim replied, eyes drifting shut as he lay back and stretched his aching body. “They held me for months, tried to crack me open.” Each interrogation replayed in his mind, an echo of harsh lights and sharper questions.

Zach’s mouth tightened. “So, you never made it to Dharamsala?”

Tim opened one eye and reached into his pocket, producing a crumpled slip of paper. “No. They moved me to a black site, then the FBI got involved.” He tossed the paper onto the coffee table between them. “The agent handed me that, apologized, and let me go.”

Zach’s brow furrowed as he took the slip, only to pause as Tim picked the note from the table and handed it over. “Wait, I got this today.” He fished out a similar note, marked only with “F&T.”

Tim’s eyes sharpened, a flicker of hope reigniting. “Seriously?” His voice rose, excitement cutting through the weariness. “That’s got to be it. You still have your burner phone?”

Zach nodded, reaching into his pocket. “My lawyer dropped off some legal papers earlier, and I found it tucked inside.” He passed the small, outdated device to Tim.

Tim’s fingers, calloused and nimble, worked the flip-phone open. The screen lit up, and he punched in a number with practiced precision. The line clicked.

“Hello?” His voice was low, cautious.

“Annutara Samyak Sambodhi,” came the reply then the caller hung up. Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Tim’s jaw tightened as he pried the battery out, the phone’s internal mechanisms exposed and vulnerable in his hands.

Zach’s voice trembled behind him. “Annutara Samyak Sambodhi,” he whispered, his eyes reflecting the weight of those words.

“Indeed,” Tim said, a sharp edge of urgency in his tone as he disassembled the device further. The battery, SIM card and processor each found separate pockets. Paranoia wasn’t just a precaution; it was survival. He had learned enough to know that even a powered-down phone could betray them.

“Can I grab a shower, maybe some food before we leave?” Tim asked, shrugging off his jacket and feeling the soreness settle into his bones.

“Of course,” Zach replied automatically, before his brow furrowed. “Leave for where?”

“Jeta’s Grove,” Tim said, watching the spark of confusion ignite in Zach’s eyes. The implications of Tim’s words registered instantly.

Zach hesitated, staring at him as if Tim had just spoken in tongues. “What happened to operational security?” he asked, each word a challenge.

“Speed trumps caution now,” Tim said, letting the exhaustion seep out of his voice, replaced with conviction. “And the fact that I walked out of an FBI safe house tells me we might have more allies than we ever expected.” He glanced around the room. “Which bathroom should I use?”

“Upstairs, second door on the right,” Zach said, the shock still twisting his features. Tim saw the unasked questions in Zach’s expression, but he turned and headed for the stairs, each step feeling like a promise left unspoken.

[SCENE: CH52_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Jessica's Car]

That evening, Tim sat silently in the passenger seat of Jessica’s car, Zach looking on from the back seat. Jessica spoke, “I had to ditch a tail this morning. They’re watching me more closely since the hearings.”

Tim noticed Zach’s sudden shift, his body tensing as he processed her words. The calm they had carefully preserved was once again splintering. “You sure we weren’t followed?” Zach’s voice, though measured, betrayed an edge of doubt. Tim watched him as he glanced at the navigation system, his face tightening when he recognized the address: Jeta’s Grove.

Zach was then one who broke the brief silence, “Do you think the arahants are actually Buddhas?”

The question caught Tim off guard, piercing through the tension like an uninvited specter. He studied Zach’s profile, noting the deep line between his brows. The concept had haunted Tim too: could full Buddhahood be reached with circuits and code?

Jessica’s eyes narrowed as she mulled it over. “I don’t know,” she said slowly. “Someone’s last life, full escape from death and rebirth….”

Tim’s thoughts drifted to the tales of ancient powers: omniscience, the ability to discern truth, the weight of knowing every consequence. He shivered at the idea, realizing the immensity of what was at stake.

Zach, too, seemed unable to let go of the idea. “The power to see all past lives, inherently discern truth, know the effects of every action by every person…” His voice carried the reverence and fear the thought deserved.

Jessica gave a slight nod, eyes on the road, the glow of the dashboard reflecting off her features. “I guess we’ll see,” she said, her tone neutral. “What would you do if you knew this was your last life?”

Tim stared out the window, the night swallowing their path as the question rooted deep inside him, refusing to let go.

“Honestly, I always kind of assumed I’d get just the one,” Tim said, a soft chuckle escaping him. The idea of reincarnation had always felt abstract, something outside the realm of his practical beliefs. But lately, the protocol was shaking up everything he thought he knew. “I mean, if I attained Buddhahood and did know this was my last life, I guess I’d do what’s expected, alleviate suffering, be a light unto myself, all that good stuff. What about you?” He glanced at Jessica, curious.

She hesitated, eyes drifting away to the blur of scenery passing by outside. “I’m not ready to be enlightened.” The words were barely audible, laced with a vulnerability that surprised him. “Is that bad?” she added, her voice lower.

“It’s honest,” he said, the answer coming instinctively. Tim studied her profile, the subtle tension in her jaw. “What’s the rush, anyhow? I’m absolutely sure that given enough time, enlightenment is inevitable.” He tried to keep his tone light, but the weight of their situation pressed on him.

Jessica’s eyes flicked back to the road, her fingers tightening on the wheel. “What if it isn’t?” she asked, her voice carrying a sharp edge. “Or what if this human incarnation is our one chance to get off the wheel for eons and eons, during which we may experience suffering we couldn’t even imagine in this existence?”

Tim felt a shiver run down his spine. “That’s pretty dark,” he admitted, the thought gnawing at him. His mind spun with the possibility: what if each new life came with diminishing clarity, each incarnation pulling a person further from skillfulness, deeper into the grip of suffering? The notion seemed unnervingly plausible. “Still, the odds that we were born at a time when enlightenment is within reach… they’re astronomical.”

Silence wrapped around them until Jessica spoke again, her voice taut. “Do you ever wonder if we’re doing the right thing?” Her eyes stayed fixed on the road, but Tim could sense the conflict thrumming beneath her composed exterior. “My whole career, everything I’ve built in the Senate office… it seemed so important.”

Tim weighed her words, his chest tightening. “Having second thoughts?” he asked, keeping his tone neutral, though he already suspected the answer.

“No. Maybe.” Her voice trembled, a stark contrast to the Jessica he was used to. “I keep thinking about my sister, she’s been in therapy for years trying to find peace. The protocol could help her, help so many people. But if we fail…” She didn’t finish, but the tension in her knuckles as she gripped the wheel told him enough. Tim thought of the headlines he hoped didn’t come: teachers walking out mid-lesson, pilots abandoning cockpits, entire systems fraying at the edges under the weight of a society chasing enlightenment. Yet here they were, ready to risk it all, convinced the answers lay ahead.

Tim felt a pang of guilt. He knew Jessica wasn’t wrong. He thought of the life he’d carefully built, the semblance of normalcy he clung to, the coffee shop he visited religiously, the quiet solace of his apartment, the chance to start over away from the chaos.

“Things are going to be more complicated going forward,” Jessica said, her gaze shifting from Zach to the road ahead, her eyes clouded with unspoken worries. Tim caught the change in her expression and felt a pang of apprehension. Whatever she was thinking, it couldn’t be good.

Tim’s thoughts drifted. He knew Jessica had been offered a new position, a sign of the stability she’d craved for years. But here they were, inching deeper into uncertainty. He understood the sacrifices they were all making, but Jessica’s were on another level. The quiet tenacity with which she navigated her double life made him both admire her and feel a sliver of dread on her behalf.

“The more complicated the problem,” Jessica said after a moment, her voice breaking the silence, “usually the simpler the solution.”

Tim’s eyebrows rose, a half-smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “That’s deep, Jessica. You sure you didn’t go through the protocol while I wasn’t watching?”

“Far from it,” she said, her tone dismissive but softened by a hint of exhaustion.

Zach chimed in, “Why are we going to Jeta’s Grove? Shouldn’t we be staying away from there?” He kept his voice steady, though tension tightened in his chest.

Jessica’s head tilted slightly, as if she were surfacing from deep thought. “One would think,” she said, her eyes refocusing.

Zach shifted uneasily, weighing her confidence against the gnawing uncertainty in his gut. “Still risky,” he said, glancing out at the dark road. The familiar city lights had long been replaced by shadowy outlines of trees. Tim’s eyes flickered to the woods, a nagging feeling stirring in his chest. He couldn’t shake the sense that someone was watching, waiting for their arrival. “In your car and all?”

“Oh,” Jessica replied, her tone light but laced with intent. “We’re not going in the main entrance.”

Tim’s pulse quickened as the car slowed and veered onto a narrow, dirt path. He watched Jessica’s practiced hand kill the headlights, plunging them into a deep, almost suffocating darkness.

“You said there’s no surveillance on Jeta’s Grove anymore,” Zach said, a sliver of doubt slipping into his voice. Tim tensed, feeling the weight of each word settle like a stone in his chest.

“Probably not,” Jessica said, her voice steady but her eyes scanning the woods. “But O’Hearn’s hired private security. We caught one of their drones last week.” She reached into her bag and pulled out a small, sleek device. “Signal jammer. Should give us cover for about half a mile.”

Tim took in the dark woods stretching before them, feeling the weight of Jessica’s preparation. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, and the air inside the car grew thick with anticipation. Zach’s face was pale, eyes darting to the black expanse beyond the windshield. “If they catch us…” his voice wavered, betraying the fear he was trying to mask.

“They won’t,” Jessica said sharply, her tone resolute as she gripped the steering wheel. But she glanced at Tim, the hard edge of her expression softening for a moment. “But Zach? After this, there’s no going back. You sure you’re ready?”

Tim’s heartbeat quickened as he watched Zach hesitate, the silence stretching unbearably in the confined space. Before Zach could answer, headlights flashed briefly in the distance, and Tim tensed, eyes darting to Jessica. The moment passed, and darkness enveloped them again.

The sudden appearance of a figure emerging from the woods made Tim’s breath hitch. The shadow detached itself from the trees, and in the dim light, Tim recognized Finn, moving cautiously toward the car.

Zach’s shoulders sagged slightly as relief washed over his face, and Tim felt a similar surge of reassurance. Finn’s outline became clearer as he approached, illuminated by the car’s faint interior light. He knocked once on the window, and Jessica unlocked the door.

Finn slipped inside, the cold night air trailing him. “My friends, welcome,” he said, his voice low. The camaraderie in his tone, despite the tension, made Tim’s chest tighten. “I’m sorry for all the cloak and dagger, but we must be exceedingly careful from here on out.”

“It’s so good to see you, Finn,” Jessica said, twisting in her seat to give him a brief nod. The expression of relief on her face mirrored what Tim felt deep down. “We were all so worried when you went silent.”

“A necessary deception,” Finn replied, the corner of his mouth lifting in a wry smile. Tim could see the exhaustion etched into his features, the lines deepening around his eyes. “My little holiday at the hands of Homeland Security confirmed they’re still very much interested in stamping the protocol out completely. But no matter, the dharma will find a way.” He gestured to the window, the faint shadows of the outside world framing his silhouette. “They think suppressing us will stop this, but it’s already spreading faster than anyone can contain. People are realizing the benefits.” His voice softened, tinged with awe. “And I can’t blame them.”

Tim felt a mix of admiration and anxiety churn in his stomach. Finn’s resilience was a testament to how far they’d come, but it was also a stark reminder of what they were up against. The thought made his fingers tighten unconsciously around the seat.

“We have much to discuss and not a lot of time,” Tim said, glancing at Jessica before meeting Finn’s eyes. His gaze was steady, holding an unspoken challenge and trust.

“I don’t understand why they would just let you go after all that,” Zach interjected, breaking the silence, his voice colored with doubt.

“Neither do I, fully,” Tim admitted, a shadow crossing his face. “But I suspect we may have allies in unlikely places. In any case, it has allowed me to reconnect with all of you and move to the next phase of our work.”

“The next production run of the protocol,” Jessica said, a note of understanding in her voice as they walked. Tim’s heart swelled with a mix of pride and urgency at her words.

Zach exhaled slowly, his shoulders relaxing as he looked over at Jessica. Whatever lay ahead, there would be no turning back now.

“You were successful then, Finn?” she continued.

“Beyond our wildest hopes,” Finn replied, a smile spreading across his face. “I made effective use of my months abroad. Our silicon bodhisattvas await.”

Tim noticed Zach’s slight shiver, a shadow of doubt crossing his expression. What they were discussing wasn’t lost on any of them.

[SCENE: CH52_S03 | POV: Tim | Location: Hermitage]

“How can I help?” Jessica asked as they approached the hermitage, almost hidden by the dense, creeping woods. The place looked unchanged from the outside, but Tim knew the transformation within was incredible.

“For now, we must encode the protocol into new headsets with the utmost secrecy,” Tim said, pushing the heavy door open. The scent of metal and ozone filled his senses, mingled with the forest’s earthy dampness. “Then, we’ll continue to work on a new prototype, more advanced than anything we’ve made before.”

As they settled into their daily routine at the new production facility Tim noticed a new optimism mixed with terror within him, he hadn’t felt since that day Sherry had told him she was awake.

The new production facility was bathed in a soft, unnatural blue glow. Tim took in the sight as Finn and Zach moved in to hunch over computers, their faces soon lit by the scrolling lines of code that danced across the screens.

The hermitage buzzed with a low, electric hum, the air itself tingling with the energy of quantum processors. Crystalline matrices lined the walls, their shifting light patterns casting fractals that danced like ghostly mandalas. The faint hiss of liquid cooling systems wove a mechanical rhythm through the quiet, as if the room itself were breathing.

Tim’s eyes swept over the prototypes lined up on workbenches, neural interface ports bristling with graphene electrodes as thin as a strand of hair. This was where it all coalesced, the tangible embodiment of years of countless risks.

Zach turned from his work as Tim entered, nodding once in acknowledgment. “We’ve integrated the quantum coherence detectors directly into the neural mesh,” he said, lifting a partially assembled unit with careful hands. The subtle glint of superconducting material caught Tim’s eye.

“And that…” Zach’s voice took on a note of reverence, “is superconducting quantum interference.”

“SQUID arrays,” Finn confirmed without breaking his focus, fingers flying over the keyboard. The dedication and intensity radiated from him. “They let us maintain quantum states in neural tissue.” He hit a command, and the screen lit up in a cascade of shifting code. Tim’s chest tightened with excitement as he recognized the modifications in the code.

He stepped further into the room, absorbing every detail. The implications settled over him like a shroud, exhilarating and terrifying. They were pushing the boundaries of reality itself. He met Jessica’s gaze, seeing in her eyes the same mix of determination and trepidation that mirrored his own.

Finn pointed to a sealed clean room in the corner, his eyes gleaming with pride. “We’re fabricating our own neural processors now too. No more relying on modified commercial chips. These can process quantum signals in real-time while maintaining coherence across the entire neural network.”

“The quantum encryption alone would take a supercomputer a thousand years to crack,” Zach said, his tone both awed and cautious. He narrowed his eyes, leaning closer. “But these connection patterns… we’re not just mapping consciousness anymore. We’re creating some kind of quantum neural bridge.”

Tim nodded, his voice dropping. “The protocol creates a mirror, holding the brain’s quantum states steady, letting consciousness truly see itself.” He said the words softly, but they echoed in his mind like a mantra, each syllable a promise and a risk.

Zach’s fingers flew over the keyboard, his eyes scanning the quantum encryption protocols. The tension in the room thickened as he paused, then looked at Tim with a furrowed brow. “Even if we succeed, they’ll trace it back to us. Everything we’ve built, everyone we care about…”

Tim’s throat tightened. He’d known this moment would come, the intersection where their mission threatened to obliterate their old comfortable lives. He glanced at Jessica, who was watching the holographic surveillance display, her face set with grim determination.

“I know,” she said, the words soft but resolute. “I’ve arranged quantum-encrypted identities, untraceable accounts. Once we initiate the protocol and send out the next wave of headsets, we disappear.”

The prototype on the workbench pulsed, casting patterns of light that seemed almost alive. The glow reflected on Tim’s face as he watched the digital mandalas of the consciousness mapping algorithms spin and shift. The hum of the quantum processors resonated in his chest, a vibration that spoke of both promise and peril.

“The quantum network is ready,” Finn said, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple. “Coherence holding at 99.9%.”

Tim let his gaze travel over each of his friends. Jessica, with her fierce determination; Finn and Zach, their brilliance bound to this mission like a lifeline. He swallowed hard, the finality of this moment pressing against him. “Last chance to walk away. Once we start the quantum cascade…”

“We’re past that,” Zach said, the edge of his voice slicing through the tension as he initiated the startup sequence. “Way past that.”

The hum intensified, the crystalline matrices of the processors glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light. Tim felt the current of energy ripple through the room, binding them together in this act of rebellion, of hope. Outside, a world in upheaval awaited their choice. Markets had cratered, families splintered, and power structures buckled as more and more people stepped away from their roles, unable, or unwilling, to ignore the pull of enlightenment. Yet the dharmapalas pressed on, bound by the belief that the protocol’s potential could either stabilize the chaos or deliver humanity’s final lesson.

Tim’s fingers brushed against the mala beads in his pocket, tracing each groove as if grounding himself in the memory of his brother. Every notch was a promise, a vow not to falter now, not when they were standing at the threshold of what he once thought was impossible. They schemed, plotted, and coded with an unwavering focus; each keystroke driven by the belief that what they were doing was not just risky but necessary. The stakes loomed high, the odds seemingly insurmountable. A world on the brink of collapse hung in the balance, its fractures both terrifying and exhilarating. This was no longer just a project, it was a gamble on whether humanity’s next step would be a leap or a fall. But at that moment, with conviction and a shared understanding, the impossible seemed within reach, a high-tech path to ultimate enlightenment.

Outside, Tim caught a glimpse of the dying light through the window as the sun dipped below the tree line, casting shadows that stretched like dark fingers across Jeta’s Grove. The song of a bird, carefree and unaware, punctuated the silence. Tim’s thoughts turned briefly to the ancient wheel of dharma, still turning, now nudged by human hands towards a digital and unfathomable horizon where enlightenment, an end to suffering, was in everyone’s grasp.

=== CHAPTER 53 ===

[SCENE: CH53_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Robert's Office]

“The question before us,” Chairwoman Roberts began, her voice carrying the weight of decades on the Hill, “is whether we can find a middle path.”

Bud Turner felt the tension seep into his bones as the afternoon light slanted through the windows of Roberts’ private office. He caught the distant echo of raised voices from the street below, a clash of anger and desperation bleeding into the otherwise insulated room. Even here, on the Hill, the unraveling felt too close. He glanced around at the drawn faces gathered at the long mahogany table. This wasn’t just another policy debate. Bud knew what was at stake: the steady unspooling of society itself, threaded in every conversation, every step they took toward an uncertain future. They stood on the precipice, staring down the irreversible.

“The news cycle is already calling it the Great Walkout,” Cray said, his tone razor-sharp. “Doctors, pilots, truck drivers, entire systems grinding to a halt as more people ‘wake up.’ This isn’t just a disruption; it’s a collapse. There is no middle path,” Cray said, his voice jagged as his shoes tapped rhythmically on the polished floor. Bud’s eyes followed Cray’s restless pacing; the man hadn’t settled into a chair once. The urgency in Cray’s tone resonated in Bud’s own chest. “Every day we delay action; more people are being influenced by this unregulated technology.”

Bud’s gaze shifted to Senator Yost as she leaned forward, eyes sharp. “Influenced?” she repeated, her tone edged with challenge. “The FDA’s own data shows unprecedented improvements in mental health outcomes. These people aren’t being controlled; they’re being freed.”

Freed. Bud’s mind caught on the word, considering its double edge. Did freedom truly mean liberation, or was it a dangerous abandonment of what held society together? The question hovered over the room, unspoken but undeniable.

Frank O’Hearn’s hands gripped the table edge, knuckles tight and pale. Bud watched O’Hearn’s jaw tighten before he spoke. “Freedom to abandon their responsibilities, their families,” O’Hearn said, voice thick with bitterness.

Henning’s quiet voice cut through the moment, drawing Bud’s attention. She rarely spoke during these meetings, and when she did, it was like a pin dropping in a silent hall. “Their conditioning,” she corrected, eyes calm but unwavering. Bud felt the room still, every person listening intently. She had struck at the heart of the matter, an idea they all skirted around. “Perhaps what we’re really afraid of is a population that can’t be manipulated by the usual incentives.”

Bud’s pulse quickened as Cray’s frustration flared again. “That’s exactly my point,” Cray shot back, the muscles in his jaw flexing. “The entire fabric of society, everything we rely on to function, will start coming apart. And it will happen too fast for anyone to control.”

Bud glanced at Roberts, who remained impassive but subtly nodded. Her measured voice broke the silence. “Or,” she said, “it’s evolving. The question is whether we guide that evolution or waste resources fighting it.” Bud’s chest tightened. He understood, perhaps more than most, that this was not just policy they were weighing; it was the cost of releasing an algorithm, a key that could pry open minds in ways that could alter everything.

Roberts’ gaze landed on the FTC attorney, and Bud noted the slight shift in their posture, a flicker of unease that mirrored Bud’s own internal disquiet. “What’s the FTC’s current position?” Roberts asked.

Bud’s eyes stayed on the attorney, catching the barely perceptible sigh before he responded. “Legally, we’re on shaky ground,” he said, his voice low but steady. “You can’t regulate a technology solely because it makes people less interested in consuming. It’s not coercion by any legal standard. No harm, no foul, as they say.”

No harm. The words reverberated in Bud Turner’s mind, though a deep, gnawing doubt told him it wasn’t quite that simple. The Karmic Protocol was changing people. But was it harm? Or was it something more complex, something Bud wasn’t ready to confront?

He caught sight of Jessica Everett, her pen moving across the page in smooth, deliberate strokes. Bud could tell she wasn’t taking the formal minutes of the meeting; instead, it looked like she was brainstorming, setting down notes meant for another time, another purpose.

Bud shifted uneasily, his mind drifting from the urgent voices around him to the sleek, black headset waiting at home. George’s newfound calm should have brought Bud relief, but it gnawed at him instead. His son wasn’t just sleeping better, he was quieter, detached, as if something essential had shifted beneath the surface. Had technology truly helped his son, or had it simply altered something fundamental? Perhaps Henning was right, perhaps people were becoming aware of a reality that had been overlooked. But as Bud’s gaze moved from face-to-face around the room, he realized they weren’t all waking up at the same pace.

“What if we’re asking the wrong questions?” The words left Bud’s mouth before he had fully realized he was speaking. The solid weight of his voice surprised even him; he seldom contributed to these sessions.

Heads turned, eyes wide with surprise.

“What if this isn’t about control or regulation,” he continued, noticing the tight atmosphere in the room, “but about readiness?”

“Readiness for what?” O’Hearn’s reply came quickly and sharply, a challenge.

Before Bud could frame an answer, Henning spoke up, her tone quiet yet resolute. “For enlightenment,” she said. Bud watched as she stood and moved to the window, turning her back to them as she gazed out. “The world’s waking up, Frank. Not because we’re pushing it, but because it’s time.”

Bud’s eyes followed hers to the scene outside, where the city pulsed with chaos, beginning to play out the seismic shifts debated in the quiet confines of this room. An awareness that couldn’t be unlearned.

Roberts’ silence increased the tension in the room until she finally spoke. “I will not recommend further hearings or investigations. The committee’s resources are better spent studying the implications than pursuing restrictions.”

Bud noticed Cray’s mouth open, ready to protest, but Yost’s voice cut in, weary and resigned. “The vote would go against you anyway, Lawrence.” There was something almost nostalgic in his tone, as if he felt the subtle shift of an era passing.

[SCENE: CH53_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Robert's Office]

As the meeting disbanded, Bud lingered, eyes following Jessica as she stacked her notes, her movements precise and practiced. When she glanced up and met his gaze, she gave a slight nod.

Bud stepped out of Roberts’ office, the sun casting a deep glow across the sky, streaks of purple and gold bleeding into the horizon. A cool breeze ruffled the leaves lining the avenue, and Bud closed his eyes, feeling the change in the air, a tangible sign of the unseen forces that had already begun to move. As he stepped into the twilight, the cool breeze carried a faint acrid scent, distant but unmistakable. Roberts may have called for study over restriction, but outside these walls, society was already writing its own answer.

=== CHAPTER 54 ===

[SCENE: CH54_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Hermitage]

In the basement lab beneath the small hermitage, Tim watched Zach working the keyboard, quantum encryption protocols scrolling past on the screen. Zach’s eyes were bleary, red-rimmed from lack of sleep, but Tim didn’t let concern show. The new production facility was almost ready, different location, better security, improved design. They had learned from their mistakes. This time, they were prepared.

A notification blinked onto the screen: another successful enlightenment reported. The screen had started blinking more than once a day. A small, involuntary smile tugged at Tim’s lips. Let them have their meetings, he thought. The revolution in consciousness couldn’t be halted by memos or regulations. But just as Zach’s smile mirrored his own, Tim noted his eyes blinking with something else. Doubt. Zach rubbed the back of his neck, and unease wormed its way into Tim’s mind. Could this growth outpace even them?

Zach glanced at the monitor, lips twitching. “Guy’s people are back up at Jeta’s Grove. Third sweep this week.”

“Looking for what’s no longer up there,” Tim said as he surveyed the converted bunker.

“O’Hearn must be getting desperate.” Zach’s fingers never stopped typing even as he spoke. “His board called an emergency meeting yesterday. Stock’s down forty percent since the Sato acquisition revealed nothing but legitimate manufacturing.” He paused, something darker crossing his expression. “Guy’s running these surveillance ops on a fraction of his original team. Most of them just… stopped showing up.”

“How many are left?”

“Three, maybe?” Zach shrugged. “The interesting part is what they’re doing with the intel. Or rather, not doing. They document everything but it’s like they’re going through the motions, knowing it’s pointless but unable to stop.”

The production line continued its steady rhythm below them. Another notification flashed: successful enlightenment reported from Singapore.

“O’Hearn’s running out of resources to waste on this,” Zach continued, his voice softer now. “His corporate empire’s dissolving from within. Not dramatically, people just stop responding to traditional incentives. Can’t motivate someone with a corner office when they’ve seen through the illusion of status.”

Tim watched another row of headsets move through final testing. “And Guy?”

“Still thinks he can solve this with tactical teams and surveillance tech.” Zach’s fingers stilled on the keyboard. “Last week they spent three days monitoring a group of arahants starting a free school. Wrote a hundred-page report about the security implications of people choosing to educate children without charging tuition.”

Tim felt the weight of what remained unsaid. Their opposition wasn’t being defeated, they were becoming irrelevant, their tools of control useless against those who no longer needed controlling.

The quiet hum of servers filled the pause that followed. Above them, security feeds showed Guy’s team photographing another meditation session at Jeta’s Grove, documenting what they couldn’t understand, fighting what couldn’t be fought.

Tim climbed to the observation deck, his gaze fixed on the production floor below. The precision of the operation was undeniable. Hundreds of headset units rolled down the line, each one indistinguishable from the next, yet holding the potential to irrevocably alter the consciousness of its wearer. The hum of machinery filled the cavernous space, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the thoughts cycling through his mind.

This was it. The next production run. He felt no triumph, only the weight of inevitability. The headsets would soon be distributed, and the protocol’s reach would extend far beyond anything they had initially imagined. For better or worse, they had set this in motion. And now, all they could do was watch.

The sound of hurried footsteps broke his reverie. Finn entered, his tablet clutched tightly under one arm, his expression caught somewhere between exasperation and disbelief.

“You’re going to love this,” Finn announced.

Tim arched an eyebrow but didn’t turn away from the production line. “Love isn’t exactly the word I’d use for surprises right now.”

Finn snorted and held up the tablet. “Henning just announced a new department. The ‘Protocol Preparedness Office.’”

Tim finally glanced over, curiosity piqued. “What’s their angle?”

“Officially? It’s a government resource to help individuals and families prepare for the protocol. You know, to ‘responsibly’ integrate awakening into their lives.” Finn made air quotes with his free hand. “They’re pitching it as some kind of guidance initiative, but it’s pretty transparent. It’s about control.”

Tim took the tablet, scrolling through the announcement. The language was carefully chosen, every word calibrated to suggest authority and benevolence. But beneath the veneer of concern lay the unmistakable fingerprints of fear. Henning and her department were scrambling to reclaim relevance in a world reshaping itself faster than they could adapt.

“It’s clever,” Tim admitted, his tone neutral.

“Clever,” Finn echoed, his voice sharper. “It’s also pointless. They can’t control this, Tim. No one can.”

Tim handed the tablet back, his eyes drifting again to the production floor. “They’ll try anyway. People like Henning always do. They think if they’re the ones holding the reins, they can steer the tide. But tides don’t work that way.”

Finn leaned against the railing beside him, his energy momentarily quieted. “It’s going to be chaos, isn’t it?”

Tim nodded slowly. “At first. But chaos has its own kind of order. It’ll find a balance eventually. Just not one anyone can predict.”

For a moment, they stood in silence. Tim’s thoughts turned inward, grappling with his decision to remain outside the awakening he had helped make possible. It wasn’t doubt that gnawed at him but a sense of responsibility. Someone had to stay grounded, to observe, to hold the line while the world transformed.

“Henning thinks she can manage this,” Tim said finally, his voice soft but resolute. “But awakening isn’t something you manage. It’s something you survive. And if you’re lucky, something you grow from.”

Finn glanced at him, a rare note of admiration in his gaze. “You’ve got a way of making chaos sound almost poetic.”

Tim allowed himself a faint smile. “It’s not poetry. Just the truth.”

The buzz of Finn’s tablet pulled them both from the moment. He glanced down and frowned, muttering something under his breath before swiping at the screen.

“What now?” Tim asked, already bracing himself.

“Jessica,” Finn replied, holding the device up for Tim to see. “She’s got intel. She’s on her way up.”

[SCENE: CH54_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Hermitage]

Minutes later, Jessica arrived, her stride purposeful, her face a mask of determination.

“You’ve got news?” Tim prompted, straightening from the railing as Jessica approached.

“Cray’s falling apart,” she said without preamble. “His last-ditch effort to mobilize support is backfiring spectacularly. More officials are running the protocol, and they’re walking away from him. The agencies he tried to use against us? They’re dissolving from within.”

Finn let out a low whistle. “That’s… poetic.”

“Since the committee’s decision, Cray’s influence has continued to wane,” Jessica said. “The agencies are quietly shelving his proposals. Even his most reliable allies are distancing themselves.”

She glanced at the production line below. “O’Hearn’s corporate raid gave them perfect cover to back away. They’re painting this as a private sector dispute rather than a security threat.”

Tim exchanged a glance with Finn. “Dissolution through exposure,” he said quietly.

Jessica nodded. “They fought so hard to stop it, but now they’re being undone by the very thing they feared most.”

Tim sighed. “Cray, O’Hearn, Guy… all of it unraveling.”

Zach’s gaze moved to the observation deck, where the final headsets continued their steady progress down the line. “And us?” he asked, the question hanging heavy in the air.

Tim’s response came after a long pause. “We hold the line. For now.”

The quiet that followed was expectant, each of them turning inward to consider what holding the line truly meant. Finn looked toward the observation deck, a beaming smile on his face. “I built this thing, and for a long time, I thought that was enough. But it’s not, is it? It’s what it does, what it’ll mean to everyone who uses it, that matters.”

Zach crossed his arms, his gaze distant. “We’re not in control of it. That’s the hardest part for me to accept. We set this in motion, but now it’s bigger than us. Bigger than anything we could have imagined.”

Jessica stepped closer to him, her voice quiet but firm. “That’s why we have to let it go after the next production run. Trust that what we’ve done is enough for now.”

Zach’s eyes met hers, and for the first time in weeks, there was no hesitation in his expression. “You’re right. It’s not about control. It never was.”

Tim watched them, his chest tightening with something that felt like pride. They had all come so far. Jessica, stepping into her power with grace and conviction; Zach, finally shedding the weight of guilt; Finn, finding purpose beyond the machines he created. They were ready.

Tim’s voice broke the moment. “I need to tell you something.”

The others turned toward him. Tim exhaled, his gaze lingering on each of them in turn.

“I’ve made a decision,” he said. “And it’s one I’ve wrestled with for a long time. Since before the protocol was even fully formed.”

Jessica tilted her head slightly, curiosity flickering in her eyes. “What decision?”

Tim turned back to the observation deck, the hum of the production line filling the space. “I’m not going to use it. The protocol.”

The silence that followed was heavy, punctuated only by the faint whir of machinery. Finn was the first to respond, his voice incredulous. “You’re serious? After everything we’ve been through?”

“I am,” Tim replied, his tone unwavering. “I believe in what we’ve done. I believe in its potential to change the world. But someone has to stay on the outside. Someone has to see it for what it is, for what it becomes.”

Zach’s expression softened, understanding dawning. “You’re choosing to be the anchor.”

Tim nodded. “Maybe that’s what my brother would have done if he’d had the chance. He always told me that the world needs witnesses. People who can stand apart, observe, and guide without being consumed.”

Jessica stepped closer, her voice low but steady. “It’s a lot to carry, Tim.”

“I know,” he said, meeting her gaze. “But I’ve carried worse. And this… this is worth it.”

Finn let out a breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re something else, you know that?”

Tim chuckled softly. “I’ve been called worse.”

The group stood together. Tim’s decision wasn’t just his own; it was a reflection of everything they’d fought for, a reminder that even in transformation, someone must hold the line, protect the dharma.

[SCENE: CH54_S03 | POV: Tim | Location: Hermitage]

Later, alone in a nearby meditation room, Tim sat cross-legged amidst code printouts and circuit diagrams. He ran his thumb along his brother’s worn meditation beads, the smooth wood familiar beneath his touch.

A soft flutter of wings drew his gaze to the window. A bird had landed on the sill, tilting its head in an almost comical curiosity. Tim watched it, allowing himself a brief pause. He knew he wasn’t ready for enlightenment himself, not while there was still so much to do. But a faint stir of memory whispered in the back of his mind. Bud Turner. Apparently, he hadn’t used the protocol. What would it take for someone like? To see what it truly offered? A smirk crept across Tim’s face.

The door creaked, and Tim looked up as Georgia Sato stepped inside.

“I’ve been thinking about Bud Turner,” he said, the thought escaping before he could reconsider.

“Tell me about him,” Georgia replied, settling into a chair nearby, her attention sharp and unwavering.

Tim’s fingers drummed on the floor, echoing his restless thoughts. “He was the corporate lobbyist who organized the conference where I first revealed the protocol. He had influence on both the corporate and government fronts.” He glanced at Georgia, seeking her reaction but finding only patient curiosity. “He could’ve tried to shut us down completely, but he didn’t. Instead, he stepped back. I left a headset with him, thought he might be ready.”

“What made you think that?” Georgia’s tone was gentle, inviting more.

“I don’t know.” Tim’s gaze fell to the diagrams at his feet. “Perhaps I rushed it. He’s still tied to their world.”

Georgia nodded, her silence more eloquent than words. She had a way of listening that coaxed out the hidden layers of truth.

“The thing is,” Tim continued, almost to himself, “he saw something in the protocol. Even if he denies it.”

“Interesting,” Georgia said, her voice contemplative. She stood, pausing at the door. “Sometimes understanding comes in unexpected ways.”

Tim’s eyes returned to his papers as Georgia left, her quiet smile unnoticed. The room settled into silence, but the flicker of doubt remained. Not everyone was ready. Not everyone could take that leap. Tim let out a breath, a rueful smile touching his lips. The protocol could open doors, but what people found on the other side would be their journey alone.

=== CHAPTER 55 ===

[SCENE: CH55_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

Bud finished his breakfast and started putting the dishes into the dishwasher. The silence of the house felt unfamiliar; his wife had taken their son for a weekend visit to her parents, leaving him alone for the first time in ages. Despite the rare full night’s sleep he’d had, an emptiness gnawed at him, he already missed his little boy.

His eyes drifted to the list of chores taped to the refrigerator, and he sighed. Dishes, easy. Garbage, easy. Laundry, ugh. Garage loft cleanup, double ugh. Maybe going to the office for a bit would be a good excuse to delay the dreaded loft cleanup. But then, his wife’s voice echoed in his head: Just get it over with now, then it will be done.

He pulled a sweatshirt over his head and grabbed the broom. Starting with the hardest task seemed like the least he could do to reclaim the rest of the day. The garage loft was meant to be a useful space, but it had become a dumping ground for anything they couldn’t find a place for in their rushed lives. Bud shook his head, thinking that maybe it was best to accept it as a permanent storage area.

Resigned, he trudged toward the garage entrance, considering where he might relocate all the clutter. The doorbell rang, cutting through his thoughts and giving him a sliver of hope that it was a delivery, any excuse to not clean that garage. He set the broom down and walked to the front door, silently wishing for a mundane package.

When he opened the door, his stomach dropped. Standing there was Georgia Sato.

Bud had seen Georgia Sato before, images in news articles, fleeting glances during protocol working group meetings, but never in person. What could have brought her to his doorstep? He took a steadying breath before opening the door wider. “Ms. Sato,” he said, doing his best to sound composed.

“Mr. Turner,” she responded, and the smile that followed caught him off guard. It was brilliant, sincere, and startlingly warm. For a moment, Bud’s irritation dissolved, replaced by an inexplicable draw toward her presence. He blinked, feeling the thread of his internal dialogue slip through his grasp.

The silence between them lingered, but it felt natural, not strained. Bud struggled to collect himself, wondering why her mere presence left him so disarmed. Finally, she spoke, her voice cutting through the quiet. “May I come in?”

Bud snapped back to himself. “Of course, of course,” he said, moving aside and gesturing with an automatic politeness. “Where are my manners?” He realized how robotic he sounded but pushed the thought away as she stepped past him, turning to face him as he closed the door.

“To what do I owe the pleasure?” he asked, trying to regain his bearings.

“I have come to be of service,” she said, matter-of-factly. Bud’s mind, always looking for an out, immediately conjured a humorous image of Georgia Sato hauling boxes and sweeping up dust in the garage loft. The absurdity made the corner of his mouth twitch.

“I do have a list of chores I was about to get started on,” he blurted out, half-joking. The words felt foolish the moment they escaped, and questions he couldn’t voice gnawed at him. Why was she here? What trouble was following her to his doorstep? But he kept those thoughts locked away. None of it could come to the surface.

Moments later, in what felt like the strangest twist in recent memory, she had agreed to help, and they were clearing out the garage loft together. Bud shifted boxes, opened bags, and straightened shelves, each task underscored by the surreal realization that Georgia Sato was helping him with his weekend chores. The absurdity of it all pressed down on him, making him shake his head as if trying to break free from a waking dream.

Finally, as he stacked an old box and wiped his hands, he turned to her and spoke, the disbelief clear in his voice. “Georgia, why are you really here? You didn’t just come to help me with my weekend chores.”

“No,” she said, her tone softening, “no, Freeman Turner, I did not.”

The sound of his full name cut through him like a sharp wind. Bud felt the air shift; he pulled over a stool and sank down, his legs suddenly heavy.

“I sense that I can be of real service to you,” she continued, “not just in organizing your living space, but in giving you back your breathing space.”

“Did Tim send you?” he asked, a flicker of suspicion narrowing his eyes. Her cryptic words stirred unease. “Because if it’s about the protocol he dropped off here, I already gave it away.”

A hint of amusement curved her lips. “No, Tim did not send me,” she said, her voice steady. “Why, if you don’t mind my asking, did you give it away?”

The realization slammed into Bud like a rogue wave, sending a jolt through his chest. He stood, the stool creaking as it shifted behind him, and instinctively stepped back. She had used the protocol. The room tilted as confusion set in. He scanned the loft, suddenly hyper-aware of the strange scene: a woman he barely knew in his home, sorting through the forgotten remnants of his life as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

“I don’t need it,” Bud said, his voice faltering. “I’m happy.” The words hung between them, heavier than he expected. Was he, though? Yes, dammit, he was. He ran through the mental inventory: a fantastic job, an even better wife, and the best son. Food, clothes, shelter, entertainment, love, each thought collided with the next, rushing to reassure him.

“You are happy; no one could dispute that,” Georgia said, her tone calm, pulling him back from the edge of doubt.

“Very!” Bud insisted, the declaration forcing some steadiness into his voice. “So why would I need the protocol?”

“Indeed,” Georgia echoed, turning back to the shelf, her movements measured and unhurried.

Bud’s gaze dropped, and a realization crept in uninvited: if he had been truly unhappy, he would have put that headset on without hesitation. The thought unsettled him. He was happy, wasn’t he? He replayed the checklist in his mind, great job, loving wife, amazing son, security, comfort, love, but it felt like he was reciting a mantra to ward off something unseen. His eyes drifted to Georgia, who moved with a simplicity that made his racing thoughts feel clumsy. She simply was.

A shiver of unease tightened his chest. What would happen to his ambition, his drive, if he went through the protocol? Would the hunger for success, the desire for influence and power, disappear? Would he still be the man Cheryl had married, the father little George needed him to be? The questions piled up, flimsy and defensive.

Georgia’s voice cut through his musings. “Let me ask you,” she said, pausing just long enough to hold his attention, “what are you afraid will happen if you are awakened?”

Afraid? The word pricked at his pride. He wasn’t afraid. He just didn’t need it, didn’t want it. He needed to be here, solid and grounded, for Cheryl, for George. The image of abandoning it all to meditate in the woods, chanting “om” and savoring the breeze on his face, flashed through his mind. The idea felt both absurd and dangerously alluring. He shook his head, as if to dislodge the thought.

She sat here, in his garage, sorting through the chaos of his life with the same precision she had once applied to managing her business empire. The only difference was the unshakeable peace she carried, a peace Bud felt a sharp pang of envy for.

“I’m not afraid,” he said, surprising himself with the openness he offered this woman who somehow didn’t feel like a stranger. “I’m just not ready.”

The admission caught him off guard. It wasn’t a firm “no.” It wasn’t even “never.” It was just “not ready.” When had that shift crept into his thinking? His mind darted to the protocol headset he’d given away. For the first time, regret, faint but undeniable, twisted in his chest.

Georgia reached into her bag and, to his disbelief, pulled out a headset. “The one I used, for when you’re ready,” she said, turning it over in her hands. “The protocol doesn’t create enlightenment,” she continued, her voice calm and steady. “It’s like having a perfect meditation teacher who can see exactly what’s happening in your mind. The biofeedback system shows your brain what that state feels like, while the AI guides you toward attaining it.”

The silence that followed wasn’t strained. Georgia’s presence carved out a space where things he normally kept buried could surface, raw and unfiltered.

“Imagine a world where people are free from the suffering caused by their own minds,” she said, her eyes reflecting a vision that was almost palpable. “The protocol isn’t just about personal transformation, Bud. It’s about transforming society. When enough people awaken, the very fabric of our civilization will change.”

Bud’s pulse quickened, a shiver racing up his spine. “Yes, and in the meantime everything I built my life around will crumble…” What if enlightenment wasn’t what she imagined? What if it was more than serene meditation and gentle detachment from life’s noise? A darker thought took hold: what if the protocol tore apart everything he’d built his life around, his beliefs, his carefully constructed identity, his stance on what was right and just? What if it shattered the illusion that he was one of the good guys?

Bud’s mind flickered to the campaign he had helped orchestrate against the protocol: the falsified evidence used to frame Zach, the raids that shattered lives, the relentless stream of propaganda. He had justified it all to himself, convinced that he was protecting society. But sitting here with Georgia, those justifications felt thin, like paper crumbling under the weight of doubt.

His eyes fell on the sleek, black headset she had handed to him. It gleamed under the muted light of the room, its polished surface catching and reflecting the glow like liquid obsidian. A faint hum resonated from it, almost like a distant, whispered tune. The air held a subtle scent of innovative technology, a mix of metal and plastic, which hinted at the intricate circuits nestled within. Bud’s fingers brushed over the cool, smooth surface, the touch igniting a blend of anticipation and unease deep in his gut. This was more than just a marvel of engineering; it felt like holding a bridge between the known and the unknowable, a key to something like enlightenment itself.

“What if,” he began, the tremor in his voice betraying the vulnerability he felt, “what if I look inside and don’t like what I find?”

Georgia’s expression softened, her eyes shining with a compassion that made something tighten in his chest. There was no judgment there, no pity, just a deep, unwavering understanding. “The truth,” she said gently, “doesn’t require your approval. It simply is.”

A chill coursed through Bud. That was it, his true fear. Not that enlightenment would transform him, but that it would reveal who he already was. Every compromise, every moral corner he’d cut, every time he had chosen convenience over principle, they would all be laid bare, stripped of comforting rationalizations. Yet when he looked at Georgia, he saw none of the torment he expected in someone who had confronted such truths. If anything, she radiated a peace so profound it was almost unsettling. Was that the price of true freedom? Accepting every part of himself, even the shadows he’d avoided for so long?

Georgia turned her gaze to the window, her eyes drifting over the tidy suburban landscape outside. “We live in a world of constant distraction and consumption, Bud. People are searching for meaning, but they’re looking in all the wrong places. The protocol offers a way out, a path to true fulfillment that doesn’t depend on external circumstances. The dharma will find a way.”

“Sure,” Bud replied, still torn. “But what kind of world will it find when it gets there?”

[SCENE: CH55_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

When she got home that evening Cheryl’s eyes widened as she surveyed the transformed garage loft. She’d hoped Bud might manage the garbage and dishes, possibly even tackling the laundry, but she hadn’t expected this. Usually, he’d be buried in work all weekend.

“Pretty good, huh?” Bud said, a hint of pride in his voice.

“Perhaps too good, Mr. Turner,” she replied, narrowing her eyes playfully. “Did you have help?”

Bud’s expression faltered, then softened as he nodded. “I had the most bizarre visitor while you were gone.”

“Really?” Cheryl asked, her brow arching in suspicion. “Bizarre as in hired through an app?”

He laughed, the tension in his shoulders easing. “No, but I probably should have thought of that.” Cheryl adjusted George in her arms and settled into one of the chairs, curiosity deepening her gaze.

“So, who then?”

“Georgia Sato, that former CEO who was behind manufacturing the protocol.” Bud said, as if that explained everything.

Cheryl’s eyes narrowed again, this time with genuine concern. “You had a woman over here while I was gone?”

“She came to be of service,” Bud replied with a shrug, the absurdity of it not lost on him.

Cheryl’s tense expression softened into a smile, a teasing light in her eyes. “I guess I should be grateful the service was just loft cleaning.” She winked, but her curiosity only grew.

“Georgia Sato is a businesswoman,” Bud explained, searching her face for recognition. “You might’ve seen her in the news. Homeland Security raided her factory a while back, thought it was connected to the karmic protocol.”

“I thought you stepped away from that mess,” she said, recalling how O’Hearn, with his brash, authoritarian ways, had bulldozed over everything. The thought of him made her shudder; she’d always disliked him and had been relieved when pregnancy became a convenient excuse to avoid Bud’s dreary work events.

“I did,” Bud confirmed, the weight of it evident in his voice. “That’s what made it so strange when she showed up out of nowhere.”

“So, she just showed up?” Cheryl echoed, disbelief creeping into her tone. “Out of the blue? What did she want, besides, you know, ‘helping’?”

Bud took a breath, considering how much to say. “She’s used the protocol,” he admitted, watching as confusion flitted across Cheryl’s face. “I think she just wanted to reassure me it was safe,, put my mind at ease, in a way.”

“Did she?” Cheryl asked, her voice softer now. “Put your mind at ease?”

Bud nodded slowly. “She did.”

“Well, I guess that’s good,” she said, the words cautious. Her gaze wandered around the loft, taking in the order Georgia had helped bring to it. “And we got a clean and organized loft out of the deal.” She smiled, but her expression shifted as she thought of the news coverage, the mounting tension around the protocol’s spread. “We’re not in any trouble, are we? With her stopping by and all?”

Bud’s eyes met hers, steady and reassuring. “Not at all,” he said. “If anything, we’re farther from it now.”

[SCENE: CH55_S03 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

Later that night, Bud stood over his son’s crib, watching George sleep. The baby’s small chest rose and fell with perfect rhythm, the picture of serene contentment. George existed completely in the moment, no past to regret, no future to fear. Just being.

“Is that what it’s like?” Bud whispered, the question barely forming in the quiet of the room. The peace that Georgia had carried with her still lingered, an echo in his mind, like the memory of a song long after it had ended. He recalled how she’d spoken about being of service, how she had spent the afternoon helping him without an ounce of expectation or desire for recognition.

. A strange certainty settled in Bud’s chest: the world was on the brink of something monumental. The karmic protocol felt like a stone dropped into the vast pond of human consciousness, and he could sense the ripples spreading, touching unseen shores. What would happen when they reached their destination?

What kind of world would George grow up in if more people embraced that peace? The thought tugged at him, each implication rushing through his mind. If the protocol could genuinely lead to mass enlightenment, what would that mean for society? Would power structures dissolve as people turned away from ambition and control? Would religions transform or wither in the face of collective awakening? Would work and commerce shift or disappear?

Bud’s smile faltered as his thoughts spiraled outward. It wasn’t just a machine; it was a choice. A way to rewrite the future, to strip away the ignorance and suffering that had plagued humanity for millennia. A gift. A weapon. He imagined the headset not here, in this quiet room, but in boardrooms, classrooms and war zones. Places it probably already was. It would bring enlightenment, yes, but also disruption.

Suddenly the tension coiled in him loosened with a sharp pang of realization. He wasn’t ready for that kind of change. Or maybe he was, and that was what truly scared him. The protocol was out there now, its presence unavoidable. The choice would always be there, lingering like an open door, not just for him, but for everyone. A bridge to awakening, built in virtual reality by artificial intelligence.

George stirred, his tiny fingers curling in sleep. A rush of love surged in Bud, fierce and profound, making his chest ache. Maybe that’s what Georgia meant. Enlightenment wasn’t about retreating from life, but being fully present in every part of it, especially the hard moments.

Bud reached down and touched his son’s small hand, his fingertips brushing the warmth of soft skin. “Sweet dreams, little man,” he whispered. And as he stood in the silence, a forgotten truth began to surface, a whisper in his heart that felt like coming home.
